"**Kuramoto Oscillatory Artificial Neurons**

**1. Introduction**

Prior to the development of contemporary deep learning frameworks, artificial neural networks drew inspiration from biological neurons. Unlike the McCulloch-Pitts neuron (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), which abstracts the function of an integrate-and-fire neuron (Sherrington, 1906), current neural network components are tailored to function efficiently on modern computing hardware (Hooker, 2021). As our knowledge of the brain expands and neuroscientists uncover more about its information processing mechanisms, we are prompted to reconsider whether insights from neuroscience can inform the design of artificial neural networks.

In this work, we adopt a more contemporary perspective of neurons as dynamic, oscillatory units that interact with one another (Muller et al., 2018). Much like the binary state of a McCulloch-Pitts neuron represents the firing of a real neuron, we model an oscillatory neuron as an N-dimensional unit vector that rotates on a sphere (Lowe et al., 2023). We introduce a novel neural network architecture that employs iterative modules to update these N-dimensional oscillatory neurons using an extension of the widely known Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984), a non-linear dynamical model.

The Kuramoto model captures the synchronization of oscillators, where each update applies forces to connected oscillators, encouraging them to align or oppose each other. This process mirrors the concept of binding in neuroscience and can be interpreted as a form of distributed, continuous clustering. As a result, networks that incorporate this mechanism tend to compress their representations through synchronization.

We integrate the Kuramoto model into an artificial neural network by applying the differential equations of the model to each neuron. This leads to the creation of artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons (AKOrN), which can be integrated with various layer types such as fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and attention mechanisms.

Our investigation into the capabilities of AKOrN reveals that its underlying neuronal mechanism significantly alters network behavior. AKOrN excels in object discovery by effectively binding object features with performance comparable to slot-based models, enhances the reasoning power of self-attention mechanisms, and exhibits strong robustness against random, adversarial, and natural perturbations, with impressive calibration.

**2. Motivation**

It has long been recognized that neurons communicate through lateral connections (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962; Somers et al., 1995). In fact, adjacent neurons often group their activity (Gray et al., 1989; Mountcastle, 1997), and these groups tend to compete for the explanation of incoming data. This ""competitive learning"" offers the benefit of information compression as we progress through the network layers, supporting the process of abstraction by creating an information bottleneck (Amari & Arbib, 1977). Moreover, the competition leads to specialization, with higher-level neurons focusing on different aspects of the input. This is facilitated by synchronization: akin to fireflies synchronizing in the night, neurons tend to align their activity with their neighbors, resulting in compressed representations. This concept has been previously applied in artificial neural networks to model ""binding"" between neurons, where neurons representing features like shape, color, and object are synchronized to represent a composite concept such as a blue square toy (Mozer et al., 1991; Reichert & Serre, 2013; Lowe et al., 2022). In this paper, we employ an N-dimensional version of the Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984) to model this synchronization.

One key advantage of our model is that it naturally incorporates spatiotemporal representations in the form of traveling waves (Keller et al., 2024), for which there is substantial evidence in the neuroscientific literature. Although the exact role of traveling waves in the brain is still not fully understood, they are hypothesized to play a role in short-term memory, long-range coordination between brain regions, and various cognitive functions (Rubino et al., 2006; Lubenov & Siapas, 2009; Fell & Axmacher, 2011; Zhang et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2019; Muller et al., 2016; Davis et al., 2020; Benigno et al., 2023). For instance, Muller et al. (2016) found that during sleep, oscillatory patterns in the thalamocortical network form circular wave-like structures, possibly aiding in memory consolidation. Similarly, Davis et al. (2020) proposed that spontaneous traveling waves in the visual cortex influence synaptic activity, serving as a gating mechanism. In the generalized Kuramoto model, these traveling waves naturally emerge as neighboring"

**1. Introduction**  
Prior to the rise of modern deep learning techniques, artificial neural networks were largely inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons. Unlike the McCulloch-Pitts neuron (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), which was an abstraction of the integrate-and-fire neuron (Sherrington, 1906), contemporary neural network components are optimized for performance on modern computing hardware (Hooker, 2021). As our comprehension of the brain continues to grow, and neuroscientists uncover more about how the brain processes information, we can revisit the question: can insights from neuroscience serve as a foundation for designing more effective artificial neural networks?

In this paper, we adopt a contemporary dynamical perspective, viewing neurons as oscillatory units that interact with one another (Muller et al., 2018). Much like the McCulloch-Pitts neuron abstracts the firing of a real neuron into a binary state, we propose representing an oscillating neuron as an N-dimensional unit vector that rotates on a sphere (Lowe et al., 2023). Based on this abstraction, we develop a novel neural network architecture that incorporates iterative modules, which update N-dimensional oscillatory neurons using a generalized version of the Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984), a well-known non-linear dynamical system.

The Kuramoto model describes how oscillators can synchronize with each other. In this context, each update applies forces to connected oscillators, encouraging them to align or oppose each other. This process mirrors the concept of binding in neuroscience, which can be interpreted as a distributed and continuous form of clustering. Consequently, networks that implement this mechanism tend to compress their representations through synchronization.

We integrate the Kuramoto model into an artificial neural network by applying its governing differential equations to each neuron. The resulting artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons (AKOrN) can be incorporated into various layer structures, including fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and attention mechanisms.

Our investigation of AKOrN reveals that its oscillatory mechanism significantly alters the behavior of neural networks. AKOrN demonstrates strong feature binding, matching competitive models in object discovery tasks, enhances the reasoning power of self-attention, and improves robustness against random, adversarial, and natural perturbations, with impressive calibration accuracy.

**2. Motivation**  
The importance of lateral connections among neurons has been recognized since the early days of neuroscience (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962; Somers et al., 1995). In fact, neighboring neurons often exhibit clustered activity (Gray et al., 1989; Mountcastle, 1997), and these clusters compete to explain the input. This competitive learning process has the benefit of compressing information as it progresses through the network, enabling more efficient abstraction through the formation of an information bottleneck (Amari & Arbib, 1977). Furthermore, this competition leads to the specialization of higher-level neurons, as they focus on different aspects of the input. This specialization is made possible by synchronization, much like fireflies synchronize their flashing in the night, leading to a compression of their representations. This concept has been previously applied in artificial neural networks to model ""binding,"" where neurons representing features such as color, shape, and object type are synchronized to represent a composite object like a blue square toy (Mozer et al., 1991; Reichert & Serre, 2013; Lowe et al., 2022). In this paper, we use an N-dimensional extension of the Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984) to model such synchronization.

A key advantage of our model is its ability to naturally incorporate spatiotemporal representations in the form of traveling waves (Keller et al., 2024), a phenomenon well-documented in neuroscientific research.

Our exploration of AKOrN reveals that its underlying neuronal mechanism significantly alters network behavior. AKOrN excels in object discovery by effectively binding features with competitive performance to slot-based models, enhances the reasoning power of self-attention mechanisms, and improves robustness against various types of perturbations—random, adversarial, and natural—with strong calibration.

**2. Motivation**  
It has long been recognized that neurons communicate through lateral connections (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962; Somers et al., 1995). Indeed, neighboring neurons often exhibit coordinated activity (Gray et al., 1989; Mountcastle, 1997), and these activity clusters compete to explain sensory input. This ""competitive learning"" process leads to information compression as data progresses through the network, enabling abstraction through an information bottleneck (Amari & Arbib, 1977). Moreover, this competition encourages higher-level neurons to specialize in specific aspects of the input, a process facilitated by synchronization.

Synchronization allows neurons to coordinate their firing with neighboring cells, leading to the compression of their representations. This concept has been previously applied in artificial neural networks to model ""binding,"" where neurons representing features like shape, color, and object are synchronized to form a unified representation (e.g., a square blue toy) (Mozer et al., 1991; Reichert & Serre, 2013; Lowe et al., 2022).

Much like the binary state of the McCulloch-Pitts neuron represents the firing of a real neuron, we abstract an oscillating neuron as an N-dimensional vector that moves across a sphere (Lowe et al., 2023). Based on this abstraction, we introduce a novel neural network architecture composed of iterative modules that update these N-dimensional oscillatory neurons using a generalized version of the Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984), a well-known non-linear dynamical model.

Prior to the development of contemporary deep learning frameworks, artificial neural networks drew inspiration from biological neurons. Unlike the McCulloch-Pitts neuron (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), which was modeled after the integrate-and-fire neuron (Sherrington, 1906), current neural network components are engineered to function efficiently on modern computing hardware (Hooker, 2021). As our comprehension of the brain continues to evolve, and as neuroscientists uncover more about how information is processed, we can reconsider whether insights from neuroscience can inform the design of artificial neural networks.

In this paper, we adopt a contemporary perspective on neurons as oscillatory units that are interconnected with one another (Muller et al., 2018).

The resulting artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons (AKOrN) can be integrated into various layer structures, including fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and attention mechanisms.

Our investigation into the capabilities of AKOrN reveals that its underlying neuronal mechanism significantly alters the behavior of the network. AKOrN effectively binds object features with performance comparable to slot-based models in object discovery, enhances the reasoning power of self-attention, and demonstrates improved robustness against random, adversarial, and natural perturbations, with excellent calibration.

In this paper, we employ an N-dimensional extension of the Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984) to model this synchronization.

One advantage of our model is its natural ability to incorporate spatiotemporal representations in the form of traveling waves (Keller et al., 2024), a phenomenon well-documented in neuroscience. While the exact role of traveling waves in the brain is still under investigation, they have been proposed to play a role in short-term memory, long-range coordination across brain regions, and other cognitive functions (Rubino et al., 2006; Lubenov & Siapas, 2009; Fell & Axmacher, 2011; Zhang et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2019; Muller et al., 2016; Davis et al., 2020; Benigno et al., 2023). For instance, Muller et al. (2016) observed that oscillatory patterns in the thalamocortical network during sleep form circular wave-like patterns, potentially explaining how memories are consolidated. Davis et al. (2020) suggest that spontaneous traveling waves in the visual cortex regulate synaptic activity, acting as a gating mechanism. In the generalized Kuramoto model, traveling waves naturally emerge as neighboring oscillators begin to synchronize (see the left side of Fig. 1, and Fig."

**1. INTRODUCTION**  
Prior to the rise of modern deep learning architectures, artificial neural networks were modeled after biological neurons. Unlike the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, which abstracts the integrate-and-fire mechanism of a biological neuron (Sherrington, 1906), contemporary neural network designs prioritize compatibility with modern computational hardware (Hooker, 2021). As our understanding of the brain advances, and neuroscientists uncover more about how the brain processes information, we can reconsider whether insights from neuroscience might inform the design of artificial neural networks.

In this work, we adopt a contemporary dynamic perspective of neurons as oscillatory units that interact with one another (Muller et al., 2018). Just as the binary state of the McCulloch-Pitts neuron represents the firing behavior of a real neuron, we abstract an oscillating neuron as an N-dimensional unit vector that rotates on a spherical surface (Lowe et al., 2023). We propose a new neural network architecture that employs iterative modules to update N-dimensional oscillatory neurons, based on a generalization of the well-known non-linear dynamical model known as the Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984).

The Kuramoto model captures the synchronization of oscillators, where each update applies forces to connected oscillators, guiding them toward alignment or anti-alignment. This process mirrors the concept of binding in neuroscience and can be interpreted as a form of distributed, continuous clustering. Consequently, networks that implement this mechanism tend to compress their representations through synchronization.

By integrating the Kuramoto model into an artificial neural network, we apply its differential equations to each individual neuron, resulting in what we call artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons (AKOrN). These neurons can be integrated into various layer architectures, including fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and attention mechanisms.

We investigate the capabilities of AKOrN and discover that its oscillatory mechanism significantly alters the network's behavior. AKOrN effectively binds object features with competitive performance compared to slot-based models in object discovery, enhances the reasoning ability of self-attention, and improves robustness against random, adversarial, and natural perturbations, with impressive calibration.

**2. MOTIVATION**  
It has long been recognized that neurons communicate through lateral connections (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962; Somers et al., 1995). In fact, neighboring neurons often group their activities (Gray et al., 1989; Mountcastle, 1997), and these groups compete to explain the input. This ""competitive learning"" mechanism allows information to be compressed as it progresses through the layers, enabling abstraction through the creation of an information bottleneck (Amari & Arbib, 1977). Moreover, this competition drives higher-level neurons to specialize in different aspects of the input. This process is facilitated by synchronization—similar to fireflies synchronizing their flashing—resulting in the compression of their representations. This concept has been used in artificial neural networks to model ""binding"" between neurons, where neurons representing features like square, blue, and toy are synchronized to represent a square blue toy (Mozer et al., 1991; Reichert & Serre, 2013; Lowe et al., 2022). In this paper, we employ an N-dimensional extension of the Kuramoto model to simulate this synchronization.

One advantage of our model is its ability to naturally incorporate spatiotemporal representations in the form of traveling waves (Keller et al., 2024), which are well-documented in neuroscientific studies. Although their exact role in the brain is still not fully understood, it has been proposed that they play a role in short-term memory, long-range coordination between brain regions, and various cognitive functions (Rubino et al., 2006; Lubenov & Siapas, 2009; Fell & Axmacher, 2011; Zhang et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2019; Muller et al., 2016; Davis et al., 2020; Benigno et al., 2023). For example, Muller et al. (2016) observed that during sleep, oscillatory patterns in the thalamocortical network form circular wave-like structures, potentially aiding in memory consolidation. Davis et al. (2020) suggest that spontaneous traveling waves in the visual cortex influence synaptic activity, functioning as a gating mechanism. In the generalized Kuramoto model, traveling waves emerge naturally as neighboring oscillators synchronize (see the left side of Fig. 1, and Fig. 10 in the Appendix).

"**Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons**  
**1. Introduction**  
Prior to the rise of modern deep learning systems, artificial neural networks were modeled after biological neurons. Unlike the McCulloch-Pitts neuron (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), which was an abstraction of the integrate-and-fire neuron (Sherrington, 1906), contemporary neural network components are designed with modern computational hardware in mind (Hooker, 2021). As neuroscience continues to expand our understanding of how the brain processes information, we are prompted to reconsider whether principles from this field can inform the design of artificial neural networks.

In this work, we adopt a more contemporary perspective on neurons as dynamic, oscillatory units that interact with one another (Muller et al., 2018). Much like how the binary state of the McCulloch-Pitts neuron represents the firing of a real neuron, we abstract an oscillatory neuron as an N-dimensional unit vector that rotates on a sphere (Lowe et al., 2023). Based on this idea, we develop a novel neural network architecture that incorporates iterative modules capable of updating N-dimensional oscillatory neurons through an extension of the Kuramoto model, a well-established non-linear dynamical framework (Kuramoto, 1984).

The Kuramoto model describes how oscillators can synchronize with each other. Each update in the model applies forces to connected oscillators, encouraging them to align or oppose each other. This process is analogous to the concept of ""binding"" in neuroscience, and can be interpreted as a form of distributed, continuous clustering. As a result, networks that use this mechanism tend to compress their representations through synchronization.

By integrating the Kuramoto model into an artificial neural network, we apply its governing differential equations to individual neurons. This leads to the creation of artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons (AKOrN), which can be integrated into various layer structures such as fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and attention mechanisms.

Our experiments reveal that the unique neuronal mechanism of AKOrN significantly alters network behavior. AKOrN demonstrates strong feature binding, performs competitively with slot-based models in object discovery tasks, enhances the reasoning power of self-attention mechanisms, and shows improved robustness against random, adversarial, and natural perturbations, with excellent calibration performance.

**2. Motivation**  
It was early on recognized that neurons communicate through lateral connections (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962; Somers et al., 1995). In fact, neighboring neurons often cluster their activities (Gray et al., 1989; Mountcastle, 1997), and these clusters compete to explain the input. This ""competitive learning"" mechanism allows for information compression as data flows through the network, promoting abstraction by creating an information bottleneck (Amari & Arbib, 1977). Moreover, this competition encourages higher-level neurons to specialize in different aspects of the input, such as color, shape, or texture. This specialization is made possible through synchronization—similar to fireflies synchronizing their flashes, neurons align their activity with neighboring units, which in turn compresses their representations. This concept has been applied in artificial neural networks to model ""binding,"" where features like ""square,"" ""blue,"" and ""toy"" are synchronized to represent a ""blue square toy"" (Mozer et al., 1991; Reichert & Serre, 2013; Lowe et al., 2022). In this paper, we use an N-dimensional version of the Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984) to model this synchronization.

A key benefit of our model is its ability to naturally encode spatiotemporal information in the form of traveling waves (Keller et al., 2024), a phenomenon well-documented in neuroscientific research. Though their exact role in the brain is still under investigation, traveling waves are thought to play a role in short-term memory, long-range brain communication, and other cognitive functions (Rubino et al., 2006; Lubenov & Siapas, 2009; Fell & Axmacher, 2011; Zhang et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2019; Muller et al., 2016; Davis et al., 2020; Benigno et al., 2023). For instance, Muller et al. (2016) observed that oscillatory patterns in the thalamocortical network during sleep form circular wave-like structures, potentially supporting memory consolidation. Davis et al. (2020) propose that spontaneous traveling waves in the visual cortex modulate synaptic activity, acting as a gating mechanism. In the generalized Kuramoto model, traveling waves emerge naturally as neighboring oscillators synchronize (as shown in the"
