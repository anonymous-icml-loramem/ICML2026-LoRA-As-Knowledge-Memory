"**Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for System 2 Planning**

**1. Introduction**

Diffusion models have gained significant traction in the field of planning, offering a novel way to generate intricate sequences by learning trajectory distributions from extensive offline datasets (Janner et al., 2022; Ajay et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a;c;b). Unlike conventional autoregressive planning techniques, diffusion-based planners—such as Diffuser (Janner et al., 2022)—construct full trajectories by sequentially removing noise, thereby bypassing the need for a forward dynamics model. This method effectively mitigates common issues with forward models, such as poor handling of long-term dependencies and cumulative errors (Hafner et al., 2022; Hamed et al., 2024), making it particularly suitable for tasks that involve extended planning horizons or sparse reward structures.

Despite these advantages, the extent to which diffusion-based planners can improve planning accuracy through computational scaling during inference—known as inference-time scalability—remains unclear. One proposed strategy is to increase the number of denoising steps or generate more samples (Zhou et al., 2024). However, it is well-established that performance improvements from increasing denoising steps reach a plateau quickly (Karras et al., 2022; Song et al., 2021a;b), and generating multiple independent samples is inefficient since it fails to utilize information from other samples. Additionally, the challenge of managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff within this framework is still not well understood.

In contrast, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Coulom, 2007), a widely used planning technique, exhibits strong inference-time scalability. By conducting iterative simulations, MCTS enhances decision-making through exploratory feedback, allowing for improved accuracy as more computational resources are allocated. This feature has made MCTS a fundamental component in many System 2 reasoning tasks, including problem-solving in mathematics (Guan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024a) and program synthesis (Brandfonbrener et al., 2024). However, traditional MCTS depends on a forward model for tree exploration, which inherits its limitations, such as loss of global consistency. Furthermore, MCTS is typically confined to discrete action spaces and can result in an excessively large search tree in terms of both depth and breadth, leading to high computational costs, especially in environments with long horizons and large action spaces.

This leads to an important question: How can we merge the strengths of Diffuser and MCTS to overcome their respective limitations and improve the inference-time scalability of diffusion-based planning? To tackle this, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a framework that combines the trajectory generation capabilities of diffusion models with the iterative search mechanisms of MCTS, enabling more efficient and scalable planning.

MCTD is built on three core innovations. First, it restructures the denoising process into a tree-based rollout, supporting semi-autoregressive causal planning while preserving trajectory consistency. Second, it introduces guidance levels as meta-actions to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring adaptive and scalable refinement of trajectories within the diffusion framework. Third, it employs fast jumpy denoising as a simulation mechanism, allowing for efficient trajectory quality estimation without the need for resource-intensive forward model rollouts. These innovations enable the four key steps of MCTS—Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation—to be applied within the context of diffusion planning, effectively integrating structured search with generative modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that MCTD outperforms existing methods in long-horizon tasks, achieving superior scalability and solution quality.

The primary contributions of this paper are as follows: First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an MCTS-integrated diffusion planning framework that explicitly incorporates the four MCTS steps, offering an effective method for inference-time scaling in diffusion models. Second, we introduce three key innovations: Denoising as Tree-Rollout, Guidance Levels as Meta-Actions, and Jumpy Denoising as Fast Simulation. Lastly, we present experimental results that validate the effectiveness of MCTD."

**1. Introduction**

Diffusion models have recently gained attention as a powerful technique for planning, allowing the creation of complex trajectories by modeling the distribution of paths using large-scale offline data (Janner et al., 2022; Ajay et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; c; b). Unlike conventional autoregressive planning methods, diffusion-based planners, such as Diffuser (Janner et al., 2022), generate full trajectories through a series of denoising steps, eliminating the need for a forward dynamics model. This method effectively overcomes key shortcomings of forward models, such as poor modeling of long-term dependencies and error accumulation (Hafner et al., 2022; Hamed et al., 2024), making it particularly suitable for planning in environments with long horizons or sparse rewards.

Despite their advantages, it remains unclear how diffusion-based planners can improve planning accuracy through the use of inference-time scaling—a property that refers to how performance scales with computational resources. One approach is to increase the number of denoising steps or generate more samples (Zhou et al., 2024). However, performance gains from increasing denoising steps tend to plateau quickly (Karras et al., 2022; Song et al., 2021a; b), and independent sampling with multiple trials is inefficient, as it does not take advantage of the information shared among samples. Additionally, the challenge of managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff within this framework remains unresolved.

In contrast, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Coulom, 2007), a widely used planning method, exhibits strong inference-time scalability. By using iterative simulations, MCTS refines decisions based on exploratory feedback, making it highly effective at improving planning accuracy with increased computational resources. This capability has made MCTS a key component in many System 2 reasoning tasks, such as solving mathematical problems (Guan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024a) and program synthesis (Brandfonbrener et al., 2024). However, traditional MCTS relies on a forward model for tree rollouts, which inherits its limitations, including the loss of global consistency. In addition to being limited to discrete action spaces, the resulting search tree can become very large in both depth and breadth, leading to high computational demands, especially in long-horizon or large-action-space scenarios.

This raises an important question: How can we combine the strengths of Diffuser and MCTS to overcome their respective limitations and enhance the inference-time scalability of diffusion-based planning? To address this, we propose Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a framework that integrates diffusion-based trajectory generation with the iterative search capabilities of MCTS to enable more efficient and scalable planning.

Although diffusion models offer substantial benefits, the extent to which they can enhance planning accuracy through increased inference time—referred to as inference-time scalability—remains unclear. One possible strategy involves increasing the number of denoising steps or generating more samples (Zhou et al., 2024). However, performance improvements from increasing denoising steps tend to level off quickly (Karras et al., 2022; Song et al., 2021a; b), and independent sampling is inefficient because it fails to utilize information from other samples.

"**Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for System 2 Planning**

**1. Introduction**

Diffusion models have recently gained attention as a robust method for planning, allowing the creation of complex action sequences by learning trajectory distributions from extensive offline data (Janner et al., 2022; Ajay et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a, c, b). Unlike conventional autoregressive planning techniques, diffusion-based planners—such as Diffuser (Janner et al., 2022)—generate full trajectories through a sequence of denoising operations, without requiring a forward dynamics model. This approach mitigates key drawbacks of forward models, such as weak long-term dependency modeling and error propagation (Hafner et al., 2022; Hamed et al., 2024), making it especially suitable for planning tasks with extended horizons or sparse reward structures.

Although diffusion-based planning offers promising capabilities, there remains uncertainty about how these methods can achieve improved planning accuracy through increased computation during inference—a feature known as inference-time scalability. One possible strategy is to increase the number of denoising steps or generate additional samples (Zhou et al., 2024). However, performance improvements from adding more denoising steps tend to stabilize quickly (Karras et al., 2022; Song et al., 2021a, b), and generating independent samples is inefficient because it fails to utilize information from other samples. Furthermore, it is unclear how to effectively manage the exploration-exploitation tradeoff within this framework.

In contrast, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Coulom, 2007)—a widely used planning technique—exhibits strong inference-time scalability. By conducting iterative simulations, MCTS refines decisions and adapts based on feedback, leading to better planning accuracy as more computational resources are allocated. This ability has made MCTS a fundamental tool in many System 2 reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving (Guan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024a) and program synthesis (Brandfonbrener et al., 2024). However, unlike diffusion-based planners, traditional MCTS depends on a forward model for tree exploration, which carries over its limitations, such as a loss of global consistency. In addition, MCTS is typically confined to discrete action spaces, and the search tree can become very large in both depth and breadth, resulting in high computational demands, especially in long-horizon or high-dimensional action space settings.

This brings up an important question: how can we merge the advantages of Diffuser and MCTS to overcome their individual limitations and improve the scalability of diffusion-based planning? To answer this, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a framework that combines diffusion-based trajectory generation with the iterative search power of MCTS to achieve more efficient and scalable planning.

MCTD is built on three major innovations. First, it restructures the denoising process into a tree-based rollout, supporting semi-autoregressive planning while preserving trajectory coherence. Second, it incorporates guidance levels as meta-actions to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring adaptive and scalable trajectory refinement within the diffusion process. Third, it utilizes fast jumpy denoising as a simulation mechanism, efficiently estimating trajectory quality without the need for expensive forward model rollouts. These innovations enable the integration of the four MCTS steps—Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation—into a diffusion planning framework, effectively merging structured search with generative modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that MCTD outperforms existing methods in long-horizon tasks, achieving better scalability and solution quality.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a diffusion planning framework that explicitly integrates the four MCTS steps, offering an effective inference-time scaling approach for diffusion models. Second, we introduce three key innovations: Denoising as Tree-Rollout, Guidance Levels as Meta-Actions, and Jumpy Denoising as Fast Simulation. Lastly, we present experimental results that validate the effectiveness of MCTD."
