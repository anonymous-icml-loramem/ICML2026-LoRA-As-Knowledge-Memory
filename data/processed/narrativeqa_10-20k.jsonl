It states, however, that the current international system of governance is flawed and is unable to eradicate the threats of war, terrorism, anarchy and economic instability. Adding to the problem is the widespread belief that human beings are intrinsically hostile and aggressive, and that these flaws make long-term global peace and stability unsustainable.\nThe Statement presents a contrary argument that the human race has been developing and maturing through its history, that human beings are fundamentally spiritual in nature and are the creation of God. As a result, they are capable of building civilization and creating a peaceful world if they decide to do so. The Universal House of Justice asserts that peace cannot occur without religion and quotes Baha’u’llah, the founder of the Baha’i Faith. “Religion is the greatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and the peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein.”\nIt is the Universal House of Justice’s contention that source of religious strife does not lie with the different religions themselves, but rather with the negligence of humanity and the, “imposition of erroneous interpretations\". These interpretations have separated faith from reason and science from religion. Having rejected religion as irrelevant, societies around the world have adopted a wide number of ideologies that have failed to serve and support the interests of humanity as a whole.\nPeace cannot be achieved simply by banning particular weapons, resolving specific conflicts or by signing new treaties. It requires a whole new level of commitment. The statement asserts that a new framework must be adopted based on several overarching principles and a genuine interest in creating a peaceful and just world. The underlying problems that must be addressed include:\nRacism and discrimination based on race, gender and religious belief\nThe inordinate disparity between the rich and the poor\nUnbridled Nationalism\nReligious strife\nThe inequality between men and women\nThe lack of educational opportunity for many around the world\nA fundamental lack of communication between peoples\nThe Universal House of Justice goes on to say that peace must be founded on the understanding that mankind is essentially one human family. It then calls for the leaders of the world to gather and deliberate on the problem, for the full support of the United Nations and the willing assent of all people for that process of deliberation.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PROMISE OF WORLD PEACE***\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Promise of World Peace\n\n\nby Universal House of Justice\n\n\n\n\nEdition 1, (September 2006)\n\n\n\n\n\n                           BAHAâI TERMS OF USE\n\n\nYou have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any\nother information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,\nemailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,\ntransmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the\nfollowing:\n\n1.

For the first time in history\nit is possible for everyone to view the entire planet, with all its myriad\ndiversified peoples, in one perspective. World peace is not only possible\nbut inevitable. It is the next stage in the evolution of this planetâin\nthe words of one great thinker, âthe planetization of mankindâ.\n\nWhether peace is to be reached only after unimaginable horrors\nprecipitated by humanityâs stubborn clinging to old patterns of behaviour,\nor is to be embraced now by an act of consultative will, is the choice\nbefore all who inhabit the earth. At this critical juncture when the\nintractable problems confronting nations have been fused into one common\nconcern for the whole world, failure to stem the tide of conflict and\ndisorder would be unconscionably irresponsible.\n\nAmong the favourable signs are the steadily growing strength of the steps\ntowards world order taken initially near the beginning of this century in\nthe creation of the League of Nations, succeeded by the more broadly based\nUnited Nations Organization; the achievement since the Second World War of\nindependence by the majority of all the nations on earth, indicating the\ncompletion of the process of nation building, and the involvement of these\nfledgling nations with older ones in matters of mutual concern; the\nconsequent vast increase in co-operation among hitherto isolated and\nantagonistic peoples and groups in international undertakings in the\nscientific, educational, legal, economic and cultural fields; the rise in\nrecent decades of an unprecedented number of international humanitarian\norganizations; the spread of womenâs and youth movements calling for an\nend to war; and the spontaneous spawning of widening networks of ordinary\npeople seeking understanding through personal communication.\n\nThe scientific and technological advances occurring in this unusually\nblessed century portend a great surge forward in the social evolution of\nthe planet, and indicate the means by which the practical problems of\nhumanity may be solved. They provide, indeed, the very means for the\nadministration of the complex life of a united world. Yet barriers\npersist. Doubts, misconceptions, prejudices, suspicions and narrow\nself-interest beset nations and peoples in their relations one to another.\n\nIt is out of a deep sense of spiritual and moral duty that we are impelled\nat this opportune moment to invite your attention to the penetrating\ninsights first communicated to the rulers of mankind more than a century\nago by BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h, Founder of the BahÃ¡âÃ­ Faith, of which we are the\nTrustees.\n\nâThe winds of despairâ, BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h wrote, âare, alas, blowing from every\ndirection, and the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is\ndaily increasing. The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be\ndiscerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably\ndefective.â This prophetic judgement has been amply confirmed by the\ncommon experience of humanity. Flaws in the prevailing order are\nconspicuous in the inability of sovereign states organized as United\nNations to exorcize the spectre of war, the threatened collapse of the\ninternational economic order, the spread of anarchy and terrorism, and the\nintense suffering which these and other afflictions are causing to\nincreasing millions. Indeed, so much have aggression and conflict come to\ncharacterize our social, economic and religious systems, that many have\nsuccumbed to the view that such behaviour is intrinsic to human nature and\ntherefore ineradicable.\n\nWith the entrenchment of this view, a paralyzing contradiction has\ndeveloped in human affairs. On the one hand, people of all nations\nproclaim not only their readiness but their longing for peace and harmony,\nfor an end to the harrowing apprehensions tormenting their daily lives. On\nthe other, uncritical assent is given to the proposition that human beings\nare incorrigibly selfish and aggressive and thus incapable of erecting a\nsocial system at once progressive and peaceful, dynamic and harmonious, a\nsystem giving free play to individual creativity and initiative but based\non co-operation and reciprocity.\n\nAs the need for peace becomes more urgent, this fundamental contradiction,\nwhich hinders its realization, demands a reassessment of the assumptions\nupon which the commonly held view of mankindâs historical predicament is\nbased. Dispassionately examined, the evidence reveals that such conduct,\nfar from expressing manâs true self, represents a distortion of the human\nspirit. Satisfaction on this point will enable all people to set in motion\nconstructive social forces which, because they are consistent with human\nnature, will encourage harmony and co-operation instead of war and\nconflict.\n\nTo choose such a course is not to deny humanityâs past but to understand\nit. The BahÃ¡âÃ­ Faith regards the current world confusion and calamitous\ncondition in human affairs as a natural phase in an organic process\nleading ultimately and irresistibly to the unification of the human race\nin a single social order whose boundaries are those of the planet. The\nhuman race, as a distinct, organic unit, has passed through evolutionary\nstages analogous to the stages of infancy and childhood in the lives of\nits individual members, and is now in the culminating period of its\nturbulent adolescence approaching its long-awaited coming of age.\n\nA candid acknowledgement that prejudice, war and exploitation have been\nthe expression of immature stages in a vast historical process and that\nthe human race is today experiencing the unavoidable tumult which marks\nits collective coming of age is not a reason for despair but a\nprerequisite to undertaking the stupendous enterprise of building a\npeaceful world. That such an enterprise is possible, that the necessary\nconstructive forces do exist, that unifying social structures can be\nerected, is the theme we urge you to examine.\n\nWhatever suffering and turmoil the years immediately ahead may hold,\nhowever dark the immediate circumstances, the BahÃ¡âÃ­ community believes\nthat humanity can confront this supreme trial with confidence in its\nultimate outcome. Far from signalizing the end of civilization, the\nconvulsive changes towards which humanity is being ever more rapidly\nimpelled will serve to release the âpotentialities inherent in the station\nof manâ and reveal âthe full measure of his destiny on earth, the innate\nexcellence of his realityâ.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe endowments which distinguish the human race from all other forms of\nlife are summed up in what is known as the human spirit; the mind is its\nessential quality. These endowments have enabled humanity to build\ncivilizations and to prosper materially. But such accomplishments alone\nhave never satisfied the human spirit, whose mysterious nature inclines it\ntowards transcendence, a reaching towards an invisible realm, towards the\nultimate reality, that unknowable essence of essences called God. The\nreligions brought to mankind by a succession of spiritual luminaries have\nbeen the primary link between humanity and that ultimate reality, and have\ngalvanized and refined mankindâs capacity to achieve spiritual success\ntogether with social progress.\n\nNo serious attempt to set human affairs aright, to achieve world peace,\ncan ignore religion. Manâs perception and practice of it are largely the\nstuff of history. An eminent historian described religion as a âfaculty of\nhuman natureâ. That the perversion of this faculty has contributed to much\nof the confusion in society and the conflicts in and between individuals\ncan hardly be denied. But neither can any fair-minded observer discount\nthe preponderating influence exerted by religion on the vital expressions\nof civilization. Furthermore, its indispensability to social order has\nrepeatedly been demonstrated by its direct effect on laws and morality.\n\nWriting of religion as a social force, BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h said: âReligion is the\ngreatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and for\nthe peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein.â Referring to the\neclipse or corruption of religion, he wrote: âShould the lamp of religion\nbe obscured, chaos and confusion will ensue, and the lights of fairness,\nof justice, of tranquillity and peace cease to shine.â In an enumeration\nof such consequences the BahÃ¡âÃ­ writings point out that the âperversion of\nhuman nature, the degradation of human conduct, the corruption and\ndissolution of human institutions, reveal themselves, under such\ncircumstances, in their worst and most revolting aspects. Human character\nis debased, confidence is shaken, the nerves of discipline are relaxed,\nthe voice of human conscience is stilled, the sense of decency and shame\nis obscured, conceptions of duty, of solidarity, of reciprocity and\nloyalty are distorted, and the very feeling of peacefulness, of joy and of\nhope is gradually extinguished.â\n\nIf, therefore, humanity has come to a point of paralyzing conflict it must\nlook to itself, to its own negligence, to the siren voices to which it has\nlistened, for the source of the misunderstandings and confusion\nperpetrated in the name of religion. Those who have held blindly and\nselfishly to their particular orthodoxies, who have imposed on their\nvotaries erroneous and conflicting interpretations of the pronouncements\nof the Prophets of God, bear heavy responsibility for this confusionâa\nconfusion compounded by the artificial barriers erected between faith and\nreason, science and religion. For from a fair-minded examination of the\nactual utterances of the Founders of the great religions, and of the\nsocial milieus in which they were obliged to carry out their missions,\nthere is nothing to support the contentions and prejudices deranging the\nreligious communities of mankind and therefore all human affairs.\n\nThe teaching that we should treat others as we ourselves would wish to be\ntreated, an ethic variously repeated in all the great religions, lends\nforce to this latter observation in two particular respects: it sums up\nthe moral attitude, the peace-inducing aspect, extending through these\nreligions irrespective of their place or time of origin; it also signifies\nan aspect of unity which is their essential virtue, a virtue mankind in\nits disjointed view of history has failed to appreciate.\n\nHad humanity seen the Educators of its collective childhood in their true\ncharacter, as agents of one civilizing process, it would no doubt have\nreaped incalculably greater benefits from the cumulative effects of their\nsuccessive missions. This, alas, it failed to do.\n\nThe resurgence of fanatical religious fervour occurring in many lands\ncannot be regarded as more than a dying convulsion. The very nature of the\nviolent and disruptive phenomena associated with it testifies to the\nspiritual bankruptcy it represents. Indeed, one of the strangest and\nsaddest features of the current outbreak of religious fanaticism is the\nextent to which, in each case, it is undermining not only the spiritual\nvalues which are conducive to the unity of mankind but also those unique\nmoral victories won by the particular religion it purports to serve.\n\nHowever vital a force religion has been in the history of mankind, and\nhowever dramatic the current resurgence of militant religious fanaticism,\nreligion and religious institutions have, for many decades, been viewed by\nincreasing numbers of people as irrelevant to the major concerns of the\nmodern world. In its place they have turned either to the hedonistic\npursuit of material satisfactions or to the following of man-made\nideologies designed to rescue society from the evident evils under which\nit groans. All too many of these ideologies, alas, instead of embracing\nthe concept of the oneness of mankind and promoting the increase of\nconcord among different peoples, have tended to deify the state, to\nsubordinate the rest of mankind to one nation, race or class, to attempt\nto suppress all discussion and interchange of ideas, or to callously\nabandon starving millions to the operations of a market system that all\ntoo clearly is aggravating the plight of the majority of mankind, while\nenabling small sections to live in a condition of affluence scarcely\ndreamed of by our forebears.\n\nHow tragic is the record of the substitute faiths that the worldly-wise of\nour age have created. In the massive disillusionment of entire populations\nwho have been taught to worship at their altars can be read historyâs\nirreversible verdict on their value. The fruits these doctrines have\nproduced, after decades of an increasingly unrestrained exercise of power\nby those who owe their ascendancy in human affairs to them, are the social\nand economic ills that blight every region of our world in the closing\nyears of the twentieth century. Underlying all these outward afflictions\nis the spiritual damage reflected in the apathy that has gripped the mass\nof the peoples of all nations and by the extinction of hope in the hearts\nof deprived and anguished millions.\n\nThe time has come when those who preach the dogmas of materialism, whether\nof the east or the west, whether of capitalism or socialism, must give\naccount of the moral stewardship they have presumed to exercise. Where is\nthe ânew worldâ promised by these ideologies? Where is the international\npeace to whose ideals they proclaim their devotion? Where are the\nbreakthroughs into new realms of cultural achievement produced by the\naggrandizement of this race, of that nation or of a particular class? Why\nis the vast majority of the worldâs peoples sinking ever deeper into\nhunger and wretchedness when wealth on a scale undreamed of by the\nPharaohs, the Caesars, or even the imperialist powers of the nineteenth\ncentury is at the disposal of the present arbiters of human affairs?\n\nMost particularly, it is in the glorification of material pursuits, at\nonce the progenitor and common feature of all such ideologies, that we\nfind the roots which nourish the falsehood that human beings are\nincorrigibly selfish and aggressive. It is here that the ground must be\ncleared for the building of a new world fit for our descendants.\n\nThat materialistic ideals have, in the light of experience, failed to\nsatisfy the needs of mankind calls for an honest acknowledgement that a\nfresh effort must now be made to find the solutions to the agonizing\nproblems of the planet. The intolerable conditions pervading society\nbespeak a common failure of all, a circumstance which tends to incite\nrather than relieve the entrenchment on every side. Clearly, a common\nremedial effort is urgently required. It is primarily a matter of\nattitude. Will humanity continue in its waywardness, holding to outworn\nconcepts and unworkable assumptions? Or will its leaders, regardless of\nideology, step forth and, with a resolute will, consult together in a\nunited search for appropriate solutions?\n\nThose who care for the future of the human race may well ponder this\nadvice. âIf long-cherished ideals and time-honoured institutions, if\ncertain social assumptions and religious formulae have ceased to promote\nthe welfare of the generality of mankind, if they no longer minister to\nthe needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept away and\nrelegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why should\nthese, in a world subject to the immutable law of change and decay, be\nexempt from the deterioration that must needs overtake every human\ninstitution? For legal standards, political and economic theories are\nsolely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity as a whole, and not\nhumanity to be crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any\nparticular law or doctrine.â\n\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nBanning nuclear weapons, prohibiting the use of poison gases, or outlawing\ngerm warfare will not remove the root causes of war. However important\nsuch practical measures obviously are as elements of the peace process,\nthey are in themselves too superficial to exert enduring influence.\nPeoples are ingenious enough to invent yet other forms of warfare, and to\nuse food, raw materials, finance, industrial power, ideology, and\nterrorism to subvert one another in an endless quest for supremacy and\ndominion. Nor can the present massive dislocation in the affairs of\nhumanity be resolved through the settlement of specific conflicts or\ndisagreements among nations. A genuine universal framework must be\nadopted.\n\nCertainly, there is no lack of recognition by national leaders of the\nworld-wide character of the problem, which is self-evident in the mounting\nissues that confront them daily. And there are the accumulating studies\nand solutions proposed by many concerned and enlightened groups as well as\nby agencies of the United Nations, to remove any possibility of ignorance\nas to the challenging requirements to be met. There is, however, a\nparalysis of will; and it is this that must be carefully examined and\nresolutely dealt with. This paralysis is rooted, as we have stated, in a\ndeep-seated conviction of the inevitable quarrelsomeness of mankind, which\nhas led to the reluctance to entertain the possibility of subordinating\nnational self-interest to the requirements of world order, and in an\nunwillingness to face courageously the far-reaching implications of\nestablishing a united world authority. It is also traceable to the\nincapacity of largely ignorant and subjugated masses to articulate their\ndesire for a new order in which they can live in peace, harmony and\nprosperity with all humanity.\n\nThe tentative steps towards world order, especially since World War II,\ngive hopeful signs. The increasing tendency of groups of nations to\nformalize relationships which enable them to co-operate in matters of\nmutual interest suggests that eventually all nations could overcome this\nparalysis. The Association of South East Asian Nations, the Caribbean\nCommunity and Common Market, the Central American Common Market, the\nCouncil for Mutual Economic Assistance, the European Communities, the\nLeague of Arab States, the Organization of African Unity, the Organization\nof American States, the South Pacific Forumâall the joint endeavours\nrepresented by such organizations prepare the path to world order.\n\nThe increasing attention being focused on some of the most deep-rooted\nproblems of the planet is yet another hopeful sign. Despite the obvious\nshortcomings of the United Nations, the more than two score declarations\nand conventions adopted by that organization, even where governments have\nnot been enthusiastic in their commitment, have given ordinary people a\nsense of a new lease on life. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,\nand the similar measures concerned with eliminating all forms of\ndiscrimination based on race, sex or religious belief; upholding the\nrights of the child; protecting all persons against being subjected to\ntorture; eradicating hunger and malnutrition; using scientific and\ntechnological progress in the interest of peace and the benefit of\nmankindâall such measures, if courageously enforced and expanded, will\nadvance the day when the spectre of war will have lost its power to\ndominate international relations. There is no need to stress the\nsignificance of the issues addressed by these declarations and\nconventions. However, a few such issues, because of their immediate\nrelevance to establishing world peace, deserve additional comment.\n\nRacism, one of the most baneful and persistent evils, is a major barrier\nto peace. Its practice perpetrates too outrageous a violation of the\ndignity of human beings to be countenanced under any pretext. Racism\nretards the unfoldment of the boundless potentialities of its victims,\ncorrupts its perpetrators, and blights human progress. Recognition of the\noneness of mankind, implemented by appropriate legal measures, must be\nuniversally upheld if this problem is to be overcome.\n\nThe inordinate disparity between rich and poor, a source of acute\nsuffering, keeps the world in a state of instability, virtually on the\nbrink of war. Few societies have dealt effectively with this situation.\nThe solution calls for the combined application of spiritual, moral and\npractical approaches. A fresh look at the problem is required, entailing\nconsultation with experts from a wide spectrum of disciplines, devoid of\neconomic and ideological polemics, and involving the people directly\naffected in the decisions that must urgently be made. It is an issue that\nis bound up not only with the necessity for eliminating extremes of wealth\nand poverty but also with those spiritual verities the understanding of\nwhich can produce a new universal attitude. Fostering such an attitude is\nitself a major part of the solution.\n\nUnbridled nationalism, as distinguished from a sane and legitimate\npatriotism, must give way to a wider loyalty, to the love of humanity as a\nwhole. BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡hâs statement is: âThe earth is but one country, and\nmankind its citizens.â The concept of world citizenship is a direct result\nof the contraction of the world into a single neighbourhood through\nscientific advances and of the indisputable interdependence of nations.\nLove of all the worldâs peoples does not exclude love of oneâs country.\nThe advantage of the part in a world society is best served by promoting\nthe advantage of the whole. Current international activities in various\nfields which nurture mutual affection and a sense of solidarity among\npeoples need greatly to be increased.\n\nReligious strife, throughout history, has been the cause of innumerable\nwars and conflicts, a major blight to progress, and is increasingly\nabhorrent to the people of all faiths and no faith. Followers of all\nreligions must be willing to face the basic questions which this strife\nraises, and to arrive at clear answers. How are the differences between\nthem to be resolved, both in theory and in practice? The challenge facing\nthe religious leaders of mankind is to contemplate, with hearts filled\nwith the spirit of compassion and a desire for truth, the plight of\nhumanity, and to ask themselves whether they cannot, in humility before\ntheir Almighty Creator, submerge their theological differences in a great\nspirit of mutual forbearance that will enable them to work together for\nthe advancement of human understanding and peace.\n\nThe emancipation of women, the achievement of full equality between the\nsexes, is one of the most important, though less acknowledged\nprerequisites of peace. The denial of such equality perpetrates an\ninjustice against one half of the worldâs population and promotes in men\nharmful attitudes and habits that are carried from the family to the\nworkplace, to political life, and ultimately to international relations.\nThere are no grounds, moral, practical, or biological, upon which such\ndenial can be justified. Only as women are welcomed into full partnership\nin all fields of human endeavour will the moral and psychological climate\nbe created in which international peace can emerge.\n\nThe cause of universal education, which has already enlisted in its\nservice an army of dedicated people from every faith and nation, deserves\nthe utmost support that the governments of the world can lend it. For\nignorance is indisputably the principal reason for the decline and fall of\npeoples and the perpetuation of prejudice. No nation can achieve success\nunless education is accorded all its citizens. Lack of resources limits\nthe ability of many nations to fulfil this necessity, imposing a certain\nordering of priorities. The decision-making agencies involved would do\nwell to consider giving first priority to the education of women and\ngirls, since it is through educated mothers that the benefits of knowledge\ncan be most effectively and rapidly diffused throughout society. In\nkeeping with the requirements of the times, consideration should also be\ngiven to teaching the concept of world citizenship as part of the standard\neducation of every child.\n\nA fundamental lack of communication between peoples seriously undermines\nefforts towards world peace. Adopting an international auxiliary language\nwould go far to resolving this problem and necessitates the most urgent\nattention.\n\nTwo points bear emphasizing in all these issues. One is that the abolition\nof war is not simply a matter of signing treaties and protocols; it is a\ncomplex task requiring a new level of commitment to resolving issues not\ncustomarily associated with the pursuit of peace. Based on political\nagreements alone, the idea of collective security is a chimera. The other\npoint is that the primary challenge in dealing with issues of peace is to\nraise the context to the level of principle, as distinct from pure\npragmatism. For, in essence, peace stems from an inner state supported by\na spiritual or moral attitude, and it is chiefly in evoking this attitude\nthat the possibility of enduring solutions can be found.\n\nThere are spiritual principles, or what some call human values, by which\nsolutions can be found for every social problem. Any well-intentioned\ngroup can in a general sense devise practical solutions to its problems,\nbut good intentions and practical knowledge are usually not enough. The\nessential merit of spiritual principle is that it not only presents a\nperspective which harmonizes with that which is immanent in human nature,\nit also induces an attitude, a dynamic, a will, an aspiration, which\nfacilitate the discovery and implementation of practical measures. Leaders\nof governments and all in authority would be well served in their efforts\nto solve problems if they would first seek to identify the principles\ninvolved and then be guided by them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe primary question to be resolved is how the present world, with its\nentrenched pattern of conflict, can change to a world in which harmony and\nco-operation will prevail.\n\nWorld order can be founded only on an unshakeable consciousness of the\noneness of mankind, a spiritual truth which all the human sciences\nconfirm. Anthropology, physiology, psychology, recognize only one human\nspecies, albeit infinitely varied in the secondary aspects of life.\nRecognition of this truth requires abandonment of prejudiceâprejudice of\nevery kindârace, class, colour, creed, nation, sex, degree of material\ncivilization, everything which enables people to consider themselves\nsuperior to others.\n\nAcceptance of the oneness of mankind is the first fundamental prerequisite\nfor reorganization and administration of the world as one country, the\nhome of humankind. Universal acceptance of this spiritual principle is\nessential to any successful attempt to establish world peace. It should\ntherefore be universally proclaimed, taught in schools, and constantly\nasserted in every nation as preparation for the organic change in the\nstructure of society which it implies.\n\nIn the BahÃ¡âÃ­ view, recognition of the oneness of mankind âcalls for no\nless than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole\ncivilized worldâa world organically unified in all the essential aspects\nof its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade\nand finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of\nthe national characteristics of its federated units.â\n\nElaborating the implications of this pivotal principle, Shoghi Effendi,\nthe Guardian of the BahÃ¡âÃ­ Faith, commented in 1931 that: âFar from aiming\nat the subversion of the existing foundations of society, it seeks to\nbroaden its basis, to remold its institutions in a manner consonant with\nthe needs of an ever-changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate\nallegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is\nneither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in menâs\nhearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the\nevils of excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore,\nnor does it attempt to suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of\nclimate, of history, of language and tradition, of thought and habit, that\ndifferentiate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider\nloyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human\nrace. It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and interests\nto the imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive\ncentralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on\nthe other. Its watchword is unity in diversityâ.\n\nThe achievement of such ends requires several stages in the adjustment of\nnational political attitudes, which now verge on anarchy in the absence of\nclearly defined laws or universally accepted and enforceable principles\nregulating the relationships between nations. The League of Nations, the\nUnited Nations, and the many organizations and agreements produced by them\nhave unquestionably been helpful in attenuating some of the negative\neffects of international conflicts, but they have shown themselves\nincapable of preventing war. Indeed, there have been scores of wars since\nthe end of the Second World War; many are yet raging.\n\nThe predominant aspects of this problem had already emerged in the\nnineteenth century when BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h first advanced his proposals for the\nestablishment of world peace. The principle of collective security was\npropounded by him in statements addressed to the rulers of the world.\nShoghi Effendi commented on his meaning: âWhat else could these weighty\nwords signify,â he wrote, âif they did not point to the inevitable\ncurtailment of unfettered national sovereignty as an indispensable\npreliminary to the formation of the future Commonwealth of all the nations\nof the world? Some form of a world super-state must needs be evolved, in\nwhose favour all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every\nclaim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to\nmaintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining internal order\nwithin their respective dominions. Such a state will have to include\nwithin its orbit an International Executive adequate to enforce supreme\nand unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the\ncommonwealth; a World Parliament whose members shall be elected by the\npeople in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed\nby their respective governments; and a Supreme Tribunal whose judgement\nwill have a binding effect even in such cases where the parties concerned\ndid not voluntarily agree to submit their case to its consideration.\n\nâA world community in which all economic barriers will have been\npermanently demolished and the interdependence of capital and labour\ndefinitely recognized; in which the clamour of religious fanaticism and\nstrife will have been forever stilled; in which the flame of racial\nanimosity will have been finally extinguished; in which a single code of\ninternational lawâthe product of the considered judgement of the worldâs\nfederated representativesâshall have as its sanction the instant and\ncoercive intervention of the combined forces of the federated units; and\nfinally a world community in which the fury of a capricious and militant\nnationalism will have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of\nworld citizenshipâsuch indeed, appears, in its broadest outline, the Order\nanticipated by BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the\nfairest fruit of a slowly maturing age.â\n\nThe implementation of these far-reaching measures was indicated by\nBahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h: âThe time must come when the imperative necessity for the\nholding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally\nrealized. The rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, and,\nparticipating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as\nwill lay the foundations of the worldâs Great Peace amongst men.â\n\nThe courage, the resolution, the pure motive, the selfless love of one\npeople for anotherâall the spiritual and moral qualities required for\neffecting this momentous step towards peace are focused on the will to\nact. And it is towards arousing the necessary volition that earnest\nconsideration must be given to the reality of man, namely, his thought. To\nunderstand the relevance of this potent reality is also to appreciate the\nsocial necessity of actualizing its unique value through candid,\ndispassionate and cordial consultation, and of acting upon the results of\nthis process. BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h insistently drew attention to the virtues and\nindispensability of consultation for ordering human affairs. He said:\nâConsultation bestows greater awareness and transmutes conjecture into\ncertitude. It is a shining light which, in a dark world, leads the way and\nguides. For everything there is and will continue to be a station of\nperfection and maturity. The maturity of the gift of understanding is made\nmanifest through consultation.â The very attempt to achieve peace through\nthe consultative action he proposed can release such a salutary spirit\namong the peoples of the earth that no power could resist the final,\ntriumphal outcome.\n\nConcerning the proceedings for this world gathering, âAbduâl-BahÃ¡, the son\nof BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h and authorized interpreter of his teachings, offered these\ninsights: âThey must make the Cause of Peace the object of general\nconsultation, and seek by every means in their power to establish a Union\nof the nations of the world. They must conclude a binding treaty and\nestablish a covenant, the provisions of which shall be sound, inviolable\nand definite. They must proclaim it to all the world and obtain for it the\nsanction of all the human race. This supreme and noble undertakingâthe\nreal source of the peace and well-being of all the worldâshould be\nregarded as sacred by all that dwell on earth. All the forces of humanity\nmust be mobilized to ensure the stability and permanence of this Most\nGreat Covenant. In this all-embracing Pact the limits and frontiers of\neach and every nation should be clearly fixed, the principles underlying\nthe relations of governments towards one another definitely laid down, and\nall international agreements and obligations ascertained. In like manner,\nthe size of the armaments of every government should be strictly limited,\nfor if the preparations for war and the military forces of any nation\nshould be allowed to increase, they will arouse the suspicion of others.\nThe fundamental principle underlying this solemn Pact should be so fixed\nthat if any government later violate any one of its provisions, all the\ngovernments on earth should arise to reduce it to utter submission, nay\nthe human race as a whole should resolve, with every power at its\ndisposal, to destroy that government. Should this greatest of all remedies\nbe applied to the sick body of the world, it will assuredly recover from\nits ills and will remain eternally safe and secure.â\n\nThe holding of this mighty convocation is long overdue.\n\nWith all the ardour of our hearts, we appeal to the leaders of all nations\nto seize this opportune moment and take irreversible steps to convoke this\nworld meeting. All the forces of history impel the human race towards this\nact which will mark for all time the dawn of its long-awaited maturity.\n\nWill not the United Nations, with the full support of its membership, rise\nto the high purposes of such a crowning event?\n\nLet men and women, youth and children everywhere recognize the eternal\nmerit of this imperative action for all peoples and lift up their voices\nin willing assent. Indeed, let it be this generation that inaugurates this\nglorious stage in the evolution of social life on the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe source of the optimism we feel is a vision transcending the cessation\nof war and the creation of agencies of international co-operation.\nPermanent peace among nations is an essential stage, but not, BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h\nasserts, the ultimate goal of the social development of humanity. Beyond\nthe initial armistice forced upon the world by the fear of nuclear\nholocaust, beyond the political peace reluctantly entered into by\nsuspicious rival nations, beyond pragmatic arrangements for security and\ncoexistence, beyond even the many experiments in co-operation which these\nsteps will make possible lies the crowning goal: the unification of all\nthe peoples of the world in one universal family.\n\nDisunity is a danger that the nations and peoples of the earth can no\nlonger endure; the consequences are too terrible to contemplate, too\nobvious to require any demonstration. âThe well-being of mankind,â\nBahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h wrote more than a century ago, âits peace and security, are\nunattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.â In\nobserving that âmankind is groaning, is dying to be led to unity, and to\nterminate its age-long martyrdomâ, Shoghi Effendi further commented that:\nâUnification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of the stage which\nhuman society is now approaching. Unity of family, of tribe, of\ncity-state, and nation have been successively attempted and fully\nestablished. World unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity is\nstriving. Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in\nstate sovereignty is moving towards a climax. A world, growing to\nmaturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of\nhuman relationships, and establish once for all the machinery that can\nbest incarnate this fundamental principle of its life.â\n\nAll contemporary forces of change validate this view. The proofs can be\ndiscerned in the many examples already cited of the favourable signs\ntowards world peace in current international movements and developments.\nThe army of men and women, drawn from virtually every culture, race and\nnation on earth, who serve the multifarious agencies of the United\nNations, represent a planetary âcivil serviceâ whose impressive\naccomplishments are indicative of the degree of co-operation that can be\nattained even under discouraging conditions. An urge towards unity, like a\nspiritual springtime, struggles to express itself through countless\ninternational congresses that bring together people from a vast array of\ndisciplines. It motivates appeals for international projects involving\nchildren and youth. Indeed, it is the real source of the remarkable\nmovement towards ecumenism by which members of historically antagonistic\nreligions and sects seem irresistibly drawn towards one another. Together\nwith the opposing tendency to warfare and self-aggrandizement against\nwhich it ceaselessly struggles, the drive towards world unity is one of\nthe dominant, pervasive features of life on the planet during the closing\nyears of the twentieth century.\n\nThe experience of the BahÃ¡âÃ­ community may be seen as an example of this\nenlarging unity. It is a community of some three to four million people\ndrawn from many nations, cultures, classes and creeds, engaged in a wide\nrange of activities serving the spiritual, social and economic needs of\nthe peoples of many lands. It is a single social organism, representative\nof the diversity of the human family, conducting its affairs through a\nsystem of commonly accepted consultative principles, and cherishing\nequally all the great outpourings of divine guidance in human history. Its\nexistence is yet another convincing proof of the practicality of its\nFounderâs vision of a united world, another evidence that humanity can\nlive as one global society, equal to whatever challenges its coming of age\nmay entail. If the BahÃ¡âÃ­ experience can contribute in whatever measure to\nreinforcing hope in the unity of the human race, we are happy to offer it\nas a model for study.\n\nIn contemplating the supreme importance of the task now challenging the\nentire world, we bow our heads in humility before the awesome majesty of\nthe divine Creator, Who out of His infinite love has created all humanity\nfrom the same stock; exalted the gem-like reality of man; honoured it with\nintellect and wisdom, nobility and immortality; and conferred upon man the\nâunique distinction and capacity to know Him and to love Himâ, a capacity\nthat âmust needs be regarded as the generating impulse and the primary\npurpose underlying the whole of creation.â\n\nWe hold firmly the conviction that all human beings have been created âto\ncarry forward an ever-advancing civilizationâ; that âto act like the\nbeasts of the field is unworthy of manâ; that the virtues that befit human\ndignity are trustworthiness, forbearance, mercy, compassion and\nloving-kindness towards all peoples. We reaffirm the belief that the\nâpotentialities inherent in the station of man, the full measure of his\ndestiny on earth, the innate excellence of his reality, must all be\nmanifested in this promised Day of God.â These are the motivations for our\nunshakeable faith that unity and peace are the attainable goal towards\nwhich humanity is striving.\n\nAt this writing, the expectant voices of BahÃ¡âÃ­s can be heard despite the\npersecution they still endure in the land in which their Faith was born.\nBy their example of steadfast hope, they bear witness to the belief that\nthe imminent realization of this age-old dream of peace is now, by virtue\nof the transforming effects of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡hâs revelation, invested with the\nforce of divine authority. Thus we convey to you not only a vision in\nwords: we summon the power of deeds of faith and sacrifice; we convey the\nanxious plea of our co-religionists everywhere for peace and unity. We\njoin with all who are the victims of aggression, all who yearn for an end\nto conflict and contention, all whose devotion to principles of peace and\nworld order promotes the ennobling purposes for which humanity was called\ninto being by an all-loving Creator.\n\nIn the earnestness of our desire to impart to you the fervour of our hope\nand the depth of our confidence, we cite the emphatic promise of\nBahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h: âThese fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away,\nand the âMost Great Peaceâ shall come.â\n\nTHE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE"}

To the former he attributes the adjectives \"legal or submissive,\" \"passive,\" and \"oriental,\" and to the latter the adjectives \"legislative, creative, organizing, or masterful,\" and \"active,\" calling it \"a more modern and much less abundant type of mind.\"\nObserving that these two minds reach \"divergent and incompatible consequences\" in the spheres of morality and public affairs, Wells analyzes the reasons for which the past-oriented mind predominates and asserts that this is principally due to the evidently greater knowability of the personal past as compared to the future. But he argues that the inference from this attitude that the future is essentially unknowable does not square with \"modern science, that is to say the relentless systematic criticism of phenomena.\" Not only has science made us knowledgeable about a distant, impersonal past, it also regards the ability successfully to predict to be a criterion of validity. Though the unpredictability of human behavior complicates the problem, the fact that \"as individuals increase in number they begin to average out\" means that \"an inductive knowledge of a great number of things in the future is becoming a human possibility.\" Confessing himself to be among \"those who believe entirely in the forces behind the individual\" rather than in individuals themselves as determining causes, Wells argues that there is \"no reason why we should not aspire to, and discover and use, safe and servicable, generalizations upon countless issues in the human destiny.\" But personal prophecy and fortune-telling will never be possible; \"the knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be general and not individual.\"\nWells devotes the last part of his text to speculations about \"the question what is to come after man,\" considering it \"the most persistently fascinating and the most insoluble question in the whole world.\" He concludes with a statement of personal faith \"in the coherency and purpose in the world and in the greatness of human destiny.\"", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE***\n\n\nE-text prepared by Charlene Taylor, Fred Salzer, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net) from page images\ngenerously made available by Internet Archive/American Libraries\n(https://archive.org/details/americana)\n\n\n\nNote: Images of the original pages are available through\n      Internet Archive/American Libraries.

Huebsch\n1913\n\nCopyright, 1913,\nBy B. W. Huebsch\n\nPrinted in U. S. A.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE FUTURE[1]\n\nBY H. G. WELLS\n\n  [1] A discourse delivered at the Royal Institution.\n\n\nIt will lead into my subject most conveniently to contrast and separate\ntwo divergent types of mind, types which are to be distinguished chiefly\nby their attitude toward time, and more particularly by the relative\nimportance they attach and the relative amount of thought they give to\nthe future.\n\nThe first of these two types of mind, and it is, I think, the\npredominant type, the type of the majority of living people, is that\nwhich seems scarcely to think of the future at all, which regards it as\na sort of blank non-existence upon which the advancing present will\npresently write events. The second type, which is, I think, a more\nmodern and much less abundant type of mind, thinks constantly and by\npreference of things to come, and of present things mainly in relation\nto the results that must arise from them. The former type of mind, when\none gets it in its purity, is retrospective in habit, and it interprets\nthe things of the present, and gives value to this and denies it to\nthat, entirely with relation to the past. The latter type of mind is\nconstructive in habit, it interprets the things of the present and\ngives value to this or that, entirely in relation to things designed or\nforeseen.\n\nWhile from that former point of view our life is simply to reap the\nconsequences of the past, from this our life is to prepare the future.\nThe former type one might speak of as the legal or submissive type of\nmind, because the business, the practice, and the training of a lawyer\ndispose him toward it; he of all men must constantly refer to the law\nmade, the right established, the precedent set, and consistently ignore\nor condemn the thing that is only seeking to establish itself. The\nlatter type of mind I might for contrast call the legislative, creative,\norganizing, or masterful type, because it is perpetually attacking and\naltering the established order of things, perpetually falling away from\nrespect for what the past has given us. It sees the world as one great\nworkshop, and the present is no more than material for the future,\nfor the thing that is yet destined to be. It is in the active mood of\nthought, while the former is in the passive; it is the mind of youth, it\nis the mind more manifest among the western nations, while the former is\nthe mind of age, the mind of the oriental.\n\nThings have been, says the legal mind, and so we are here. The creative\nmind says we are here because things have yet to be.\n\nNow I do not wish to suggest that the great mass of people belong to\neither of these two types. Indeed, I speak of them as two distinct and\ndistinguishable types mainly for convenience and in order to accentuate\ntheir distinction. There are probably very few people who brood\nconstantly upon the past without any thought of the future at all, and\nthere are probably scarcely any who live and think consistently in\nrelation to the future. The great mass of people occupy an intermediate\nposition between these extremes, they pass daily and hourly from the\npassive mood to the active, they see this thing in relation to its\nassociations and that thing in relation to its consequences, and they\ndo not even suspect that they are using two distinct methods in their\nminds.\n\nBut for all that they are distinct methods, the method of reference to\nthe past and the method of reference to the future, and their mingling\nin many of our minds no more abolishes their difference than the\nexistence of piebald horses proves that white is black.\n\nI believe that it is not sufficiently recognized just how different\nin their consequences these two methods are, and just where their\ndifference and where the failure to appreciate their difference takes\none. This present time is a period of quite extraordinary uncertainty\nand indecision upon endless questions--moral questions, Ã¦sthetic\nquestions, religious and political questions--upon which we should all\nof us be happier to feel assured and settled; and a very large amount of\nthis floating uncertainty about these important matters is due to the\nfact that with most of us these two insufficiently distinguished ways of\nlooking at things are not only present together, but in actual conflict\nin our minds, in unsuspected conflict; we pass from one to the other\nheedlessly without any clear recognition of the fundamental difference\nin conclusions that exists between the two, and we do this with\ndisastrous results to our confidence and to our consistency in dealing\nwith all sorts of things.\n\nBut before pointing out how divergent these two types or habits of\nmind really are, it is necessary to meet a possible objection to what\nhas been said. I may put that objection in this form: Is not this\ndistinction between a type of mind that thinks of the past and a type\nof mind that thinks of the future a sort of hair-splitting, almost like\ndistinguishing between people who have left hands and people who have\nright? Everybody believes that the present is entirely determined by\nthe past, you say; but then everybody believes also that the present\ndetermines the future. Are we simply separating and contrasting two\nsides of everybody's opinion? To which one replies that we are not\ndiscussing what we know and believe about the relations of past,\npresent, and future, or of the relation of cause and effect to each\nother in time. We all know the present depends for its causes on the\npast, and the future depends for its causes upon the present. But this\ndiscussion concerns the way in which we approach things upon this\ncommon ground of knowledge and belief. We may all know there is an\neast and a west, but if some of us always approach and look at things\nfrom the west, if some of us always approach and look at things from\nthe east, and if others again wander about with a pretty disregard of\ndirection, looking at things as chance determines, some of us will get\nto a westward conclusion of this journey, and some of us will get to an\neastward conclusion, and some of us will get to no definite conclusion\nat all about all sorts of important matters. And yet those who are\ntravelling east, and those who are travelling west, and those who are\nwandering haphazard, may be all upon the same ground of belief and\nstatement and amid the same assembly of proven facts. Precisely the same\nthing, divergence of result, will happen if you always approach things\nfrom the point of view of their causes, or if you approach them always\nwith a view to their probable effects. And in several very important\ngroups of human affairs it is possible to show quite clearly just how\nwidely apart the two methods, pursued each in its purity, take those who\nfollow them.\n\nI suppose that three hundred years ago all people who thought at all\nabout moral questions, about questions of Right and Wrong, deduced their\nrules of conduct absolutely and unreservedly from the past, from some\ndogmatic injunction, some finally settled decree. The great mass of\npeople do so to-day. It is written, they say. \"Thou shalt not steal,\"\nfor example--that is the sole, complete, sufficient reason why you\nshould not steal, and even to-day there is a strong aversion to admit\nthat there is any relation between the actual consequences of acts and\nthe imperatives of right and wrong. Our lives are to reap the fruits\nof determinate things, and it is still a fundamental presumption of the\nestablished morality that one must do right though the heavens fall.\nBut there are people coming into this world who would refuse to call it\nRight if it brought the heavens about our heads, however authoritative\nits sources and sanctions, and this new disposition is, I believe,\na growing one. I suppose in all ages people in a timid, hesitating,\nguilty way have tempered the austerity of a dogmatic moral code by\nsmall infractions to secure obviously kindly ends, but it was, I am\ntold, the Jesuits who first deliberately sought to qualify the moral\ninterpretation of acts by a consideration of their results. To-day there\nare few people who have not more or less clearly discovered the future\nas a more or less important factor in moral considerations. To-day there\nis a certain small proportion of people who frankly regard morality\nas a means to an end, as an overriding of immediate and personal\nconsiderations out of regard to something to be attained in the future,\nand who break away altogether from the idea of a code dogmatically\nestablished forever.\n\nMost of us are not so definite as that, but most of us are deeply\ntinged with the spirit of compromise between the past and the future;\nwe profess an unbounded allegiance to the prescriptions of the past,\nand we practise a general observance of its injunctions, but we qualify\nto a vague, variable extent with considerations of expediency. We hold,\nfor example, that we must respect our promises. But suppose we find\nunexpectedly that for one of us to keep a promise, which has been sealed\nand sworn in the most sacred fashion, must lead to the great suffering\nof some other human being, must lead, in fact, to practical evil? Would\na man do right or wrong if he broke such a promise? The practical\ndecision most modern people would make would be to break the promise.\nMost would say that they did evil to avoid a greater evil. But suppose\nit was not such very great suffering we were going to inflict, but only\nsome suffering? And suppose it was a rather important promise? With most\nof us it would then come to be a matter of weighing the promise, the\nthing of the past, against this unexpected bad consequence, the thing of\nthe future. And the smaller the overplus of evil consequences the more\nmost of us would vacillate. But neither of the two types of mind we are\ncontrasting would vacillate at all. The legal type of mind would obey\nthe past unhesitatingly, the creative would unhesitatingly sacrifice it\nto the future. The legal mind would say, \"they who break the law at any\npoint break it altogether,\" while the creative mind would say, \"let the\ndead past bury its dead.\"\n\nIt is convenient to take my illustration from the sphere of promises,\nbut it is in the realm of sexual morality that the two methods are most\nacutely in conflict.\n\nAnd I would like to suggest that until you have definitely determined\neither to obey the real or imaginary imperatives of the past, or to set\nyourself toward the demands of some ideal of the future, until you have\nmade up your mind to adhere to one or other of these two types of mental\naction in these matters, you are not even within hope of a sustained\nconsistency in the thought that underlies your acts, that in every issue\nof principle that comes upon you, you will be entirely at the mercy of\nthe intellectual mood that happens to be ascendent at that particular\nmoment in your mind.\n\nIn the sphere of public affairs also these two ways of looking at things\nwork out into equally divergent and incompatible consequences. The legal\nmind insists upon treaties, constitutions, legitimacies, and charters;\nthe legislative incessantly assails these. Whenever some period of\nstress sets in, some great conflict between institutions and the forces\nin things, there comes a sorting out of these two types of mind. The\nlegal mind becomes glorified and transfigured in the form of hopeless\nloyalty, the creative mind inspires revolutions and reconstructions.\nAnd particularly is this difference of attitude accentuated in the\ndisputes that arise out of wars. In most modern wars there is no doubt\nquite traceable on one side or the other a distinct creative idea, a\ndistinct regard for some future consequence; but the main dispute even\nin most modern wars and the sole dispute in most mediÃ¦val wars will\nbe found to be a reference, not to the future, but to the past; to\nturn upon a question of fact and right. The wars of Plantagenet and\nLancastrian England with France, for example, were based entirely upon\na dummy claim, supported by obscure legal arguments, upon the crown of\nFrance. And the arguments that centered about the late war in South\nAfrica ignored any ideal of a great united South African state almost\nentirely, and quibbled this way and that about who began the fighting\nand what was or was not written in some obscure revision of a treaty a\nscore of years ago. Yet beneath the legal issues the broad creative idea\nhas been apparent in the public mind during this war. It will be found\nmore or less definitely formulated beneath almost all the great wars of\nthe past century, and a comparison of the wars of the nineteenth century\nwith the wars of the middle ages will show, I think, that in this field\nalso there has been a discovery of the future, an increasing disposition\nto shift the reference and values from things accomplished to things to\ncome.\n\nYet though foresight creeps into our politics and a reference to\nconsequence into our morality, it is still the past that dominates our\nlives. But why? Why are we so bound to it? It is into the future we go,\nto-morrow is the eventful thing for us. There lies all that remains to\nbe felt by us and our children and all those that are dear to us. Yet we\nmarshal and order men into classes entirely with regard to the past; we\ndraw shame and honor out of the past; against the rights of property,\nthe vested interests, the agreements and establishments of the past\nthe future has no rights. Literature is for the most part history or\nhistory at one remove, and what is culture but a mold of interpretation\ninto which new things are thrust, a collection of standards, a sort\nof bed of King Og, to which all new expressions must be lopped or\nstretched? Our conveniences, like our thoughts, are all retrospective.\nWe travel on roads so narrow that they suffocate our traffic; we live\nin uncomfortable, inconvenient, life-wasting houses out of a love of\nfamiliar shapes and familiar customs and a dread of strangeness; all our\npublic affairs are cramped by local boundaries impossibly restricted\nand small. Our clothing, our habits of speech, our spelling, our weights\nand measures, our coinage, our religious and political theories, all\nwitness to the binding power of the past upon our minds. Yet we do\nnot serve the past as the Chinese have done. There are degrees. We do\nnot worship our ancestors or prescribe a rigid local costume; we dare\nto enlarge our stock of knowledge, and we qualify the classics with\noccasional adventures into original thought. Compared with the Chinese\nwe are distinctly aware of the future. But compared with what we might\nbe, the past is all our world.\n\nThe reason why the retrospective habit, the legal habit, is so dominant,\nand always has been so predominant, is of course a perfectly obvious\none. We follow a fundamental human principle and take what we can get.\nAll people believe the past is certain, defined, and knowable, and only\na few people believe that it is possible to know anything about the\nfuture. Man has acquired the habit of going to the past because it was\nthe line of least resistance for his mind. While a certain variable\nportion of the past is serviceable matter for knowledge in the case of\neveryone, the future is, to a mind without an imagination trained in\nscientific habits of thought, non-existent. All our minds are made of\nmemories. In our memories each of us has something that without any\nspecial training whatever will go back into the past and grip firmly and\nconvincingly all sorts of workable facts, sometimes more convincingly\nthan firmly. But the imagination, unless it is strengthened by a very\nsound training in the laws of causation, wanders like a lost child in\nthe blankness of things to come and returns empty.\n\nMany people believe, therefore, that there can be no sort of certainty\nabout the future. You can know no more about the future, I was\nrecently assured by a friend, than you can know which way a kitten will\njump next. And to all who hold that view, who regard the future as a\nperpetual source of convulsive surprises, as an impenetrable, incurable,\nperpetual blankness, it is right and reasonable to derive such values as\nit is necessary to attach to things from the events that have certainly\nhappened with regard to them. It is our ignorance of the future and our\npersuasion that that ignorance is absolutely incurable that alone gives\nthe past its enormous predominance in our thoughts. But through the\nages, the long unbroken succession of fortune-tellers--and they flourish\nstill--witnesses to the perpetually smoldering feeling that after all\nthere may be a better sort of knowledge--a more serviceable sort of\nknowledge than that we now possess.\n\nOn the whole there is something sympathetic for the dupe of the\nfortune-teller in the spirit of modern science; it is one of the\npersuasions that come into one's mind, as one assimilates the broad\nconception of science, that the adequacy of causation is universal; that\nin absolute fact--if not in that little bubble of relative fact which\nconstitutes the individual life--in absolute fact the future is just as\nfixed and determinate, just as settled and inevitable, just as possible\na matter of knowledge as the past. Our personal memory gives us an\nimpression of the superior reality and trustworthiness of things in the\npast, as of things that have finally committed themselves and said their\nsay, but the more clearly we master the leading conceptions of science\nthe better we understand that this impression is one of the results of\nthe peculiar conditions of our lives, and not an absolute truth. The man\nof science comes to believe at last that the events of the year A.D.\n4000 are as fixed, settled, and unchangeable as the events of the year\n1600. Only about the latter he has some material for belief and about\nthe former practically none.\n\nAnd the question arises how far this absolute ignorance of the future\nis a fixed and necessary condition of human life, and how far some\napplication of intellectual methods may not attenuate even if it does\nnot absolutely set aside the veil between ourselves and things to come.\nAnd I am venturing to suggest to you that along certain lines and with\ncertain qualifications and limitations a working knowledge of things in\nthe future is a possible and practicable thing. And in order to support\nthis suggestion I would call your attention to certain facts about our\nknowledge of the past, and more particularly I would insist upon this,\nthat about the past our range of absolute certainty is very limited\nindeed. About the past I would suggest we are inclined to overestimate\nour certainty, just as I think we are inclined to underestimate the\ncertainties of the future. And such a knowledge of the past as we have\nis not all of the same sort or derived from the same sources.\n\nLet us consider just what an educated man of to-day knows of the past.\nFirst of all he has the realest of all knowledge--the knowledge of his\nown personal experiences, his memory. Uneducated people believe their\nmemories absolutely, and most educated people believe them with a few\nreservations. Some of us take up a critical attitude even toward our own\nmemories; we know that they not only sometimes drop things out, but that\nsometimes a sort of dreaming or a strong suggestion will put things in.\nBut for all that, memory remains vivid and real as no other knowledge\ncan be, and to have seen and heard and felt is to be nearest to absolute\nconviction. Yet our memory of direct impressions is only the smallest\npart of what we know. Outside that bright area comes knowledge of a\ndifferent order--the knowledge brought to us by other people. Outside\nour immediate personal memory there comes this wider area of facts or\nquasi facts told us by more or less trustworthy people, told us by word\nof mouth or by the written word of living and of dead writers. This is\nthe past of report, rumor, tradition, and history--the second sort of\nknowledge of the past. The nearer knowledge of this sort is abundant\nand clear and detailed, remoter it becomes vaguer, still more remotely\nin time and space it dies down to brief, imperfect inscriptions and\nenigmatical traditions, and at last dies away, so far as the records and\ntraditions of humanity go, into a doubt and darkness as blank, just as\nblank, as futurity.\n\nAnd now let me remind you that this second zone of knowledge outside\nthe bright area of what we have felt and witnessed and handled for\nourselves--this zone of hearsay and history and tradition--completed the\nwhole knowledge of the past that was accessible to Shakespeare, for\nexample. To these limits man's knowledge of the past was absolutely\nconfined, save for some inklings and guesses, save for some small,\nalmost negligible beginnings, until the nineteenth century began.\nBesides the correct knowledge in this scheme of hearsay and history\na man had a certain amount of legend and error that rounded off the\npicture in a very satisfactory and misleading way, according to Bishop\nUssher, just exactly 4004 years B.C. And that was man's universal\nhistory--that was his all--until the scientific epoch began. And beyond\nthose limits--? Well, I suppose the educated man of the sixteenth\ncentury was as certain of the non-existence of anything before the\ncreation of the world as he was, and as most of us are still, of\nthe practical non-existence of the future, or at any rate he was as\nsatisfied of the impossibility of knowledge in the one direction as in\nthe other.\n\nBut modern science, that is to say the relentless systematic criticism\nof phenomena, has in the past hundred years absolutely destroyed the\nconception of a finitely distant beginning of things; has abolished such\nlimits to the past as a dated creation set, and added an enormous vista\nto that limited sixteenth century outlook. And what I would insist upon\nis that this further knowledge is a new kind of knowledge, obtained in\na new kind of way. We know to-day, quite as confidently and in many\nrespects more intimately than we know Sargon or Zenobia or Caractacus,\nthe form and the habits of creatures that no living being has ever met,\nthat no human eye has ever regarded, and the character of scenery that\nno man has ever seen or can ever possibly see; we picture to ourselves\nthe labyrinthodon raising its clumsy head above the water of the\ncarboniferous swamps in which he lived, and we figure the pterodactyls,\nthose great bird lizards, flapping their way athwart the forests of\nthe Mesozoic age with exactly the same certainty as that with which we\npicture the rhinoceros or the vulture. I doubt no more about the facts\nin this farther picture than I do about those in the nearest. I believe\nin the megatherium which I have never seen as confidently as I believe\nin the hippopotamus that has engulfed buns from my hand. A vast amount\nof detail in that farther picture is now fixed and finite for all time.\nAnd a countless number of investigators are persistently and confidently\nenlarging, amplifying, correcting, and pushing farther and farther\nback the boundaries of this greater past--this prehuman past--that the\nscientific criticism of existing phenomena has discovered and restored\nand brought for the first time into the world of human thought. We have\nbecome possessed of a new and once unsuspected history of the world--of\nwhich all the history that was known, for example, to Dr. Johnson is\nonly the brief concluding chapter; and even that concluding chapter\nhas been greatly enlarged and corrected by the exploring archÃ¦ologists\nworking strictly upon the lines of the new method--that is to say, the\ncomparison and criticism of suggestive facts.\n\nI want particularly to insist upon this, that all this outer past--this\nnon-historical past--is the product of a new and keener habit of\ninquiry, and no sort of revelation. It is simply due to a new and more\ncritical way of looking at things. Our knowledge of the geological past,\nclear and definite as it has become, is of a different and lower order\nthan the knowledge of our memory, and yet of a quite practicable and\ntrustworthy order--a knowledge good enough to go upon; and if one were\nto speak of the private memory as the personal past, of the next wider\narea of knowledge as the traditional or historical past, then one might\ncall all that great and inspiring background of remoter geological time\nthe inductive past.\n\nAnd this great discovery of the inductive past was got by the discussion\nand rediscussion and effective criticism of a number of existing\nfacts, odd-shaped lumps of stone, streaks and bandings in quarries\nand cliffs, anatomical and developmental detail that had always been\nabout in the world, that had been lying at the feet of mankind so long\nas mankind had existed, but that no one had ever dreamed before could\nsupply any information at all, much more reveal such astounding and\nenlightening vistas. Looked at in a new way they became sources of\ndazzling and penetrating light. The remoter past lit up and became a\npicture. Considered as effects, compared and criticised, they yielded a\nclairvoyant vision of the history of interminable years.\n\nAnd now, if it has been possible for men by picking out a number of\nsuggestive and significant looking things in the present, by comparing\nthem, criticising them, and discussing them, with a perpetual insistence\nupon \"Why?\" without any guiding tradition, and indeed in the teeth of\nestablished beliefs, to construct this amazing searchlight of inference\ninto the remoter past, is it really, after all, such an extravagant and\nhopeless thing to suggest that, by seeking for operating causes instead\nof for fossils, and by criticising them as persistently and thoroughly\nas the geological record has been criticised, it may be possible to\nthrow a searchlight of inference forward instead of backward, and\nto attain to a knowledge of coming things as clear, as universally\nconvincing, and infinitely more important to mankind than the clear\nvision of the past that geology has opened to us during the nineteenth\ncentury?\n\nLet us grant that anything to correspond with the memory, anything\nhaving the same relation to the future that memory has to the past,\nis out of the question. We cannot imagine, of course, that we can\never know any personal future to correspond with our personal past, or\nany traditional future to correspond with our traditional past; but\nthe possibility of an inductive future to correspond with that great\ninductive past of geology and archÃ¦ology is an altogether different\nthing.\n\nI must confess that I believe quite firmly that an inductive knowledge\nof a great number of things in the future is becoming a human\npossibility. I believe that the time is drawing near when it will be\npossible to suggest a systematic exploration of the future. And you must\nnot judge the practicability of this enterprise by the failures of the\npast. So far nothing has been attempted, so far no first-class mind has\never focused itself upon these issues; but suppose the laws of social\nand political development, for example, were given as many brains, were\ngiven as much attention, criticism, and discussion as we have given to\nthe laws of chemical combination during the last fifty years, what\nmight we not expect?\n\nTo the popular mind of to-day there is something very difficult in such\na suggestion, soberly made. But here, in this institution (the Royal\nInstitution of London) which has watched for a whole century over the\nsplendid adolescence of science, and where the spirit of science is\nsurely understood, you will know that as a matter of fact prophecy has\nalways been inseparably associated with the idea of scientific research.\n\nThe popular idea of scientific investigation is a vehement, aimless\ncollection of little facts, collected as a bower bird collects shells\nand pebbles, in methodical little rows, and out of this process, in\nsome manner unknown to the popular mind, certain conjuring tricks--the\ncelebrated \"wonders of science\"--in a sort of accidental way emerge.\nThe popular conception of all discovery is accident. But you will know\nthat the essential thing in the scientific process is not the collection\nof facts, but the analysis of facts. Facts are the raw material and not\nthe substance of science. It is analysis that has given us all ordered\nknowledge, and you know that the aim and the test and the justification\nof the scientific process is not a marketable conjuring trick, but\nprophecy. Until a scientific theory yields confident forecasts you\nknow it is unsound and tentative; it is mere theorizing, as evanescent\nas art talk or the phantoms politicians talk about. The splendid body\nof gravitational astronomy, for example, establishes itself upon\nthe certain forecast of stellar movements, and you would absolutely\nrefuse to believe its amazing assertions if it were not for these same\nunerring forecasts. The whole body of medical science aims, and claims\nthe ability, to diagnose. Meteorology constantly and persistently aims\nat prophecy, and it will never stand in a place of honor until it can\ncertainly foretell. The chemist forecasts elements before he meets\nthem--it is very properly his boast--and the splendid manner in which\nthe mind of Clerk Maxwell reached in front of all experiments and\nforetold those things that Marconi has materialized is familiar to us\nall.\n\nAll applied mathematics resolves into computation to foretell things\nwhich otherwise can only be determined by trial. Even in so unscientific\na science as economics there have been forecasts. And if I am right in\nsaying that science aims at prophecy, and if the specialist in each\nscience is in fact doing his best now to prophesy within the limits of\nhis field, what is there to stand in the way of our building up this\ngrowing body of forecast into an ordered picture of the future that\nwill be just as certain, just as strictly science, and perhaps just as\ndetailed as the picture that has been built up within the last hundred\nyears of the geological past? Well, so far and until we bring the\nprophecy down to the affairs of man and his children, it is just as\npossible to carry induction forward as back; it is just as simple and\nsure to work out the changing orbit of the earth in the future until\nthe tidal drag hauls one unchanging face at last toward the sun as it\nis to work back to its blazing and molten past. Until man comes in,\nthe inductive future is as real and convincing as the inductive past.\nBut inorganic forces are the smaller part and the minor interest in\nthis concern. Directly man becomes a factor the nature of the problem\nchanges, and our whole present interest centers on the question whether\nman is, indeed, individually and collectively incalculable, a new\nelement which entirely alters the nature of our inquiry and stamps it at\nonce as vain and hopeless, or whether his presence complicates, but does\nnot alter, the essential nature of the induction. How far may we hope\nto get trustworthy inductions about the future of man?\n\nWell, I think, on the whole, we are inclined to underrate our chance\nof certainties in the future, just as I think we are inclined to be\ntoo credulous about the historical past. The vividness of our personal\nmemories, which are the very essence of reality to us, throws a glamor\nof conviction over tradition and past inductions. But the personal\nfuture must in the very nature of things be hidden from us so long as\ntime endures, and this black ignorance at our very feet--this black\nshadow that corresponds to the brightness of our memories behind\nus--throws a glamor of uncertainty and unreality over all the future. We\nare continually surprising ourselves by our own will or want of will;\nthe individualities about us are continually producing the unexpected,\nand it is very natural to reason that as we can never be precisely sure\nbefore the time comes what we are going to do and feel, and if we can\nnever count with absolute certainty upon the acts and happenings even\nof our most intimate friends, how much the more impossible is it to\nanticipate the behavior in any direction of states and communities.\n\nIn reply to which I would advance the suggestion that an increase in\nthe number of human beings considered may positively simplify the\ncase instead of complicating it; that as the individuals increase in\nnumber they begin to average out. Let me illustrate this point by a\ncomparison. Angular pit-sand has grains of the most varied shapes.\nExamined microscopically, you will find all sorts of angles and outlines\nand variations. Before you look you can say of no particular grain what\nits outline will be. And if you shoot a load of such sand from a cart\nyou cannot foretell with any certainty where any particular grain will\nbe in the heap that you make; but you can tell--you can tell pretty\ndefinitely--the form of the heap as a whole. And further, if you pass\nthat sand through a series of shoots and finally drop it some distance\nto the ground, you will be able to foretell that grains of a certain\nsort of form and size will for the most part be found in one part of\nthe heap and grains of another sort of form and size will be found in\nanother part of the heap. In such a case, you see, the thing as a whole\nmay be simpler than its component parts, and this I submit is also\nthe case in many human affairs. So that because the individual future\neludes us completely that is no reason why we should not aspire to, and\ndiscover and use, safe and serviceable, generalizations upon countless\nimportant issues in the human destiny.\n\nBut there is a very grave and important-looking difference between a\nload of sand and a multitude of human beings, and this I must face\nand examine. Our thoughts and wills and emotions are contagious. An\nexceptional sort of sand grain, a sand grain that was exceptionally\nbig and heavy, for example, exerts no influence worth considering upon\nany other of the sand grains in the load. They will fall and roll and\nheap themselves just the same whether that exceptional grain is with\nthem or not; but an exceptional man comes into the world, a CÃ¦sar or a\nNapoleon or a Peter the Hermit, and he appears to persuade and convince\nand compel and take entire possession of the sand heap--I mean the\ncommunity--and to twist and alter its destinies to an almost unlimited\nextent. And if this is indeed the case, it reduces our project of an\ninductive knowledge of the future to very small limits. To hope to\nforetell the birth and coming of men of exceptional force and genius is\nto hope incredibly, and if, indeed, such exceptional men do as much as\nthey seem to do in warping the path of humanity, our utmost prophetic\nlimit in human affairs is a conditional sort of prophecy. If people do\nso and so, we can say, then such and such results will follow, and we\nmust admit that that is our limit.\n\nBut everybody does not believe in the importance of the leading man.\nThere are those who will say that the whole world is different by reason\nof Napoleon. There are those who will say that the world of to-day\nwould be very much as it is now if Napoleon had never been born. Other\nmen would have arisen to make Napoleon's conquests and codify the law,\nredistribute the worn-out boundaries of Europe and achieve all those\nchanges which we so readily ascribe to Napoleon's will alone. There are\nthose who believe entirely in the individual man and those who believe\nentirely in the forces behind the individual man, and for my own part\nI must confess myself a rather extreme case of the latter kind. I must\nconfess I believe that if by some juggling with space and time Julius\nCÃ¦sar, Napoleon, Edward IV., William the Conqueror, Lord Rosebery, and\nRobert Burns had all been changed at birth it would not have produced\nany serious dislocation of the course of destiny. I believe that these\ngreat men of ours are no more than images and symbols and instruments\ntaken, as it were, haphazard by the incessant and consistent forces\nbehind them; they are the pen-nibs Fate has used for her writing, the\ndiamonds upon the drill that pierces through the rock. And the more\none inclines to this trust in forces the more one will believe in the\npossibility of a reasoned inductive view of the future that will serve\nus in politics, in morals, in social contrivances, and in a thousand\nspacious ways. And even those who take the most extreme and personal\nand melodramatic view of the ways of human destiny, who see life as a\ntissue of fairy godmother births and accidental meetings and promises\nand jealousies, will, I suppose, admit there comes a limit to these\nthings--that at last personality dies away and the greater forces come\nto their own. The great man, however great he be, cannot set back the\nwhole scheme of things; what he does in right and reason will remain,\nand what he does against the greater creative forces will perish. We\ncannot foresee him; let us grant that. His personal difference, the\nsplendor of his effect, his dramatic arrangement of events will be his\nown--in other words, we cannot estimate for accidents and accelerations\nand delays; but if only we throw our web of generalization wide enough,\nif only we spin our rope of induction strong enough, the final result of\nthe great man, his ultimate surviving consequences, will come within our\nnet.\n\nSuch, then, is the sort of knowledge of the future that I believe is\nattainable and worth attaining. I believe that the deliberate direction\nof historical study and of economic and social study toward the future\nand an increasing reference, a deliberate and courageous reference,\nto the future in moral and religious discussion, would be enormously\nstimulating and enormously profitable to our intellectual life. I have\ndone my best to suggest to you that such an enterprise is now a serious\nand practicable undertaking. But at the risk of repetition I would call\nyour attention to the essential difference that must always hold between\nour attainable knowledge of the future and our existing knowledge of the\npast. The portion of the past that is brightest and most real to each\nof us is the individual past--the personal memory. The portion of the\nfuture that must remain darkest and least accessible is the individual\nfuture. Scientific prophecy will not be fortune-telling, whatever else\nit may be. Those excellent people who cast horoscopes, those illegal\nfashionable palm-reading ladies who abound so much to-day, in whom\nnobody is so foolish as to believe, and to whom everybody is foolish\nenough to go, need fear no competition from the scientific prophets.\nThe knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be general and not\nindividual; it will be no sort of knowledge that will either hamper\nus in the exercise of our individual free will or relieve us of our\npersonal responsibility.\n\nAnd now, how far is it possible at the present time to speculate on the\nparticular outline the future will assume when it is investigated in\nthis way?\n\nIt is interesting, before we answer that question, to take into account\nthe speculations of a certain sect and culture of people who already,\nbefore the middle of last century, had set their faces toward the\nfuture as the justifying explanation of the present. These were the\npositivists, whose position is still most eloquently maintained and\ndisplayed by Mr. Frederic Harrison, in spite of the great expansion of\nthe human outlook that has occurred since Comte.\n\nIf you read Mr. Harrison, and if you are also, as I presume your\npresence here indicates, saturated with that new wine of more spacious\nknowledge that has been given the world during the last fifty years,\nyou will have been greatly impressed by the peculiar limitations of\nthe positivist conception of the future. So far as I can gather, Comte\nwas, for all practical purposes, totally ignorant of that remoter\npast outside the past that is known to us by history, or if he was\nnot totally ignorant of its existence, he was, and conscientiously\nremained, ignorant of its relevancy to the history of humanity. In the\nnarrow and limited past he recognized men had always been like the\nmen of to-day; in the future he could not imagine that they would be\nanything more than men like the men of to-day. He perceived, as we all\nperceive, that the old social order was breaking up, and after a richly\nsuggestive and incomplete analysis of the forces that were breaking\nit up he set himself to plan a new static social order to replace it.\nIf you will read Comte, or, what is much easier and pleasanter, if\nyou will read Mr. Frederic Harrison, you will find this conception\nconstantly apparent--that there was once a stable condition of society\nwith humanity, so to speak, sitting down in an orderly and respectable\nmanner; that humanity has been stirred up and is on the move, and\nthat finally it will sit down again on a higher plane, and for good\nand all, cultured and happy, in the reorganized positivist state. And\nsince he could see nothing beyond man in the future, there, in that\nmillennial fashion, Comte had to end. Since he could imagine nothing\nhigher than man, he had to assert that humanity, and particularly the\nfuture of humanity, was the highest of all conceivable things. All that\nwas perfectly comprehensible in a thinker of the first half of the\nnineteenth century. But we of the early twentieth, and particularly\nthat growing majority of us who have been born since the Origin of\nSpecies was written, have no excuse for any such limited vision. Our\nimaginations have been trained upon a past in which the past that\nComte knew is scarcely more than the concluding moment. We perceive\nthat man, and all the world of men, is no more than the present phase\nof a development so great and splendid that beside this vision epics\njingle like nursery rhymes, and all the exploits of humanity shrivel to\nthe proportion of castles in the sand. We look back through countless\nmillions of years and see the will to live struggling out of the\nintertidal slime, struggling from shape to shape and from power to\npower, crawling and then walking confidently upon the land, struggling\ngeneration after generation to master the air, creeping down into the\ndarkness of the deep; we see it turn upon itself in rage and hunger\nand reshape itself anew; we watch it draw nearer and more akin to us,\nexpanding, elaborating itself, pursuing its relentless, inconceivable\npurpose, until at last it reaches us and its being beats through our\nbrains and arteries, throbs and thunders in our battleships, roars\nthrough our cities, sings in our music, and flowers in our art. And\nwhen, from that retrospect, we turn again toward the future, surely any\nthought of finality, any millennial settlement of cultured persons, has\nvanished from our minds.\n\nThis fact that man is not final is the great unmanageable, disturbing\nfact that arises upon us in the scientific discovery of the future, and\nto my mind, at any rate, the question what is to come after man is the\nmost persistently fascinating and the most insoluble question in the\nwhole world.\n\nOf course we have no answer. Such imaginations as we have refuse to\nrise to the task.\n\nBut for the nearer future, while man is still man, there are a few\ngeneral statements that seem to grow more certain. It seems to be pretty\ngenerally believed to-day that our dense populations are in the opening\nphase of a process of diffusion and aeration. It seems pretty inevitable\nalso that at least the mass of white population in the world will be\nforced some way up the scale of education and personal efficiency in\nthe next two or three decades. It is not difficult to collect reasons\nfor supposing--and such reasons have been collected--that in the near\nfuture, in a couple of hundred years, as one rash optimist has written,\nor in a thousand or so, humanity will be definitely and conscientiously\norganizing itself as a great world state--a great world state that will\npurge from itself much that is mean, much that is bestial, and much that\nmakes for individual dullness and dreariness, grayness and wretchedness\nin the world of to-day; and although we know that there is nothing\nfinal in that world state, although we see it only as something to be\nreached and passed, although we are sure there will be no such sitting\ndown to restore and perfect a culture as the positivists foretell, yet\nfew people can persuade themselves to see anything beyond that except\nin the vaguest and most general terms. That world state of more vivid,\nbeautiful, and eventful people is, so to speak, on the brow of the hill,\nand we cannot see over, though some of us can imagine great uplands\nbeyond and something, something that glitters elusively, taking first\none form and then another, through the haze. We can see no detail,\nwe can see nothing definable, and it is simply, I know, the sanguine\nnecessity of our minds that makes us believe those uplands of the\nfuture are still more gracious and splendid than we can either hope or\nimagine. But of things that can be demonstrated we have none.\n\nYet I suppose most of us entertain certain necessary persuasions,\nwithout which a moral life in this world is neither a reasonable nor a\npossible thing. All this paper is built finally upon certain negative\nbeliefs that are incapable of scientific establishment. Our lives and\npowers are limited, our scope in space and time is limited, and it is\nnot unreasonable that for fundamental beliefs we must go outside the\nsphere of reason and set our feet upon faith. Implicit in all such\nspeculations as this is a very definite and quite arbitrary belief, and\nthat belief is that neither humanity nor in truth any individual human\nbeing is living its life in vain. And it is entirely by an act of faith\nthat we must rule out of our forecasts certain possibilities, certain\nthings that one may consider improbable and against the chances, but\nthat no one upon scientific grounds can call impossible.\n\nOne must admit that it is impossible to show why certain things should\nnot utterly destroy and end the entire human race and story, why night\nshould not presently come down and make all our dreams and efforts vain.\nIt is conceivable, for example, that some great unexpected mass of\nmatter should presently rush upon us out of space, whirl sun and planets\naside like dead leaves before the breeze, and collide with and utterly\ndestroy every spark of life upon this earth. So far as positive human\nknowledge goes, this is a conceivably possible thing. There is nothing\nin science to show why such a thing should not be. It is conceivable,\ntoo, that some pestilence may presently appear, some new disease, that\nwill destroy, not 10 or 15 or 20 per cent. of the earth's inhabitants\nas pestilences have done in the past, but 100 per cent.; and so end\nour race. No one, speaking from scientific grounds alone, can say,\n\"That cannot be.\" And no one can dispute that some great disease of the\natmosphere, some trailing cometary poison, some great emanation of vapor\nfrom the interior of the earth, such as Mr. Shiel has made a brilliant\nuse of in his \"Purple Cloud,\" is consistent with every demonstrated\nfact in the world. There may arise new animals to prey upon us by land\nand sea, and there may come some drug or a wrecking madness into the\nminds of men. And finally, there is the reasonable certainty that this\nsun of ours must radiate itself toward extinction; that, at least, must\nhappen; it will grow cooler and cooler, and its planets will rotate ever\nmore sluggishly until some day this earth of ours, tideless and slow\nmoving, will be dead and frozen, and all that has lived upon it will be\nfrozen out and done with. There surely man must end. That of all such\nnightmares is the most insistently convincing.\n\nAnd yet one doesn't believe it.\n\nAt least I do not. And I do not believe in these things because I have\ncome to believe in certain other things--in the coherency and purpose in\nthe world and in the greatness of human destiny. Worlds may freeze and\nsuns may perish, but there stirs something within us now that can never\ndie again.\n\nDo not misunderstand me when I speak of the greatness of human destiny.\n\nIf I may speak quite openly to you, I will confess that, considered as\na final product, I do not think very much of myself or (saving your\npresence) my fellow-creatures. I do not think I could possibly join in\nthe worship of humanity with any gravity or sincerity. Think of it!\nThink of the positive facts. There are surely moods for all of us when\none can feel Swift's amazement that such a being should deal in pride.\nThere are moods when one can join in the laughter of Democritus; and\nthey would come oftener were not the spectacle of human littleness so\nabundantly shot with pain. But it is not only with pain that the world\nis shot--it is shot with promise. Small as our vanity and carnality make\nus, there has been a day of still smaller things. It is the long ascent\nof the past that gives the lie to our despair. We know now that all the\nblood and passion of our life were represented in the Carboniferous time\nby something--something, perhaps, cold-blooded and with a clammy skin,\nthat lurked between air and water, and fled before the giant amphibia of\nthose days.\n\nFor all the folly, blindness, and pain of our lives, we have come some\nway from that. And the distance we have travelled gives us some earnest\nof the way we have yet to go.\n\nWhy should things cease at man? Why should not this rising curve rise\nyet more steeply and swiftly? There are many things to suggest that\nwe are now in a phase of rapid and unprecedented development. The\nconditions under which men live are changing with an ever-increasing\nrapidity, and, so far as our knowledge goes, no sort of creatures have\never lived under changing conditions without undergoing the profoundest\nchanges themselves. In the past century there was more change in\nthe conditions of human life than there had been in the previous\nthousand years. A hundred years ago inventors and investigators were\nrare scattered men, and now invention and inquiry are the work of an\nunorganized army. This century will see changes that will dwarf those of\nthe nineteenth century, as those of the nineteenth dwarf those of the\neighteenth. One can see no sign anywhere that this rush of change will\nbe over presently, that the positivist dream of a social reconstruction\nand of a new static culture phase will ever be realized. Human society\nnever has been quite static, and it will presently cease to attempt\nto be static. Everything seems pointing to the belief that we are\nentering upon a progress that will go on, with an ever-widening and ever\nmore confident stride, forever. The reorganization of society that is\ngoing on now beneath the traditional appearance of things is a kinetic\nreorganization. We are getting into marching order. We have struck our\ncamp forever and we are out upon the roads.\n\nWe are in the beginning of the greatest change that humanity has ever\nundergone. There is no shock, no epoch-making incident--but then\nthere is no shock at a cloudy daybreak. At no point can we say, \"Here\nit commences, now; last minute was night and this is morning.\" But\ninsensibly we are in the day. If we care to look, we can foresee growing\nknowledge, growing order, and presently a deliberate improvement of the\nblood and character of the race. And what we can see and imagine gives\nus a measure and gives us faith for what surpasses the imagination.\n\nIt is possible to believe that all the past is but the beginning of a\nbeginning, and that all that is and has been is but the twilight of the\ndawn. It is possible to believe that all that the human mind has ever\naccomplished is but the dream before the awakening. We cannot see, there\nis no need for us to see, what this world will be like when the day has\nfully come. We are creatures of the twilight. But it is out of our race\nand lineage that minds will spring, that will reach back to us in our\nlittleness to know us better than we know ourselves, and that will reach\nforward fearlessly to comprehend this future that defeats our eyes.\n\nAll this world is heavy with the promise of greater things, and a day\nwill come, one day in the unending succession of days, when beings,\nbeings who are now latent in our thoughts and hidden in our loins,\nshall stand upon this earth as one stands upon a footstool, and shall\nlaugh and reach out their hands amid the stars.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ART _of_ LIFE SERIES\n\nEDWARD HOWARD GRIGGS, Editor\n\n\n\"The aim of this series of brief books is to illuminate the\nnever-to-be-finished art of living. There is no thought of solving the\nproblems or giving dogmatic theories of conduct.

A large solar flare damages their craft and leaves them drifting and lost in space. They make repeated attempts to contact NASA in Houston, to no avail. Soon, however, they begin to pick up strange radio communications.\nThey are puzzled that almost all of the voices are female, usually with a strong Australian accent. They overhear conversations about personal matters (including the birth of a cow) as well as unknown slang terms. Various theories are discussed by the perplexed astronauts: hallucinations? A hoax? A hostile power trying to trick them? They record and play back the conversations over and over, trying to figure out what is going on. Soon, they realize that these unknown people are aware of them and are offering to help.\nAt first, the Sunbird's commander refuses to communicate with them, suspicious of their motives. As they continue to plead with the astronauts to accept their rescue offer, the men are chilled to hear their mission referred to in historical terms. They come to realize that they were not only thrown off-course in space, but in time as well, and that their flight was lost centuries ago. They are given bare details of the current Earth: an undefined cataclysm has reduced the human population to a mere few million. Eventually, the Sunbird agrees to rendezvous with the spaceship Gloria to allow the astronauts to spacewalk to safety.\nThe Gloria is an enigma to them. Besides having an almost all-female crew, the ship is haphazard and cluttered with plants and animals on board. None of the technology seems very advanced and some of the ship's functions are powered by stationary bikes. Their culture shock is compounded by the cryptic and incomplete answers they are given concerning the Earth.\nLittle by little, the three gather clues from both observations and slips of the tongue. While crew members often refer to their \"sisters,\" there is no mention of husbands, boyfriends, or families. There are twins on board (both named Judy), yet one seems older than the other. The one male, a teen named Andy, seems strangely feminine. Technology, and science and culture in general, seems to be relatively unadvanced considering the centuries that passed.\nEventually, they learn the truth. A plague wiped out most human life, including all males. Only about 11,000 people survived, mostly concentrated in Australasia and a few other areas. They reproduce by cloning, and all living humans are clones of the original 11,000 genotypes. Babies are raised communally in crĂ¨ches, and all members of each genotype are encouraged to add their story to a book that is passed on for the inspiration and education of future \"sisters.\" Certain genotypes are given early androgen treatments (hence, the pseudo-male crew member) to increase bulk and strength for physical tasks. The resulting almost communal maleless society has settled into a peaceful patternâwithout major conflict, seemingly happy, but with little advancement.\nThe Sunbird's crew react to these revelations in different ways. The commander considers this to be a great tragedy, and believes he was chosen by God to lead these females back, with men as family leaders. Another drools at the prospect of millions of women who have not known a man's touch, and fancies himself the object of desire for them all when he returns.\nIt is then uncovered by the third crew member that his crewmates have been given a drugâone that causes them to show their \"true selves\". He realizes that they are most certainly not headed home, and the crew of the Gloria do not intend for them to survive. They are perfectly happy living without men, and the astronauts are merely being studied, pressed for any useful information, and (in the case of the over-amorous astronaut) used to obtain sperm samples, presumably to introduce fresh genetic material and create new genotypes.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK WHAT DO YOU READ? ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           WHAT DO YOU READ?\n\n                           _By Boyd Ellanby_\n\n                    _Illustrated by Malcolm Smith_\n\n     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Other Worlds\n     March 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n     the U.S.copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n     Writers have long dreamed of a plot machine, but the machines in\n     Script-Lab did much more than plot the story--they wrote it. Why\n     bother with human writers when the machines did the job so much\n     faster and better?\n\n\nHerbert would have preferred the seclusion of a coptor-taxi, but he\nknew he could not afford it. The Bureau paid its writers adequately,\nbut not enough to make them comfortable in taxis. In front of his\napartment house, he took the escalator to the Airway. It must have been\npleasant, he thought as he stepped onto the moving sidewalk, to be a\nwriter in the days when they were permitted to receive royalties and,\npresumably, to afford taxi fare.\n\nOn the rare occasions when he was forced to travel in the city, he\nusually tried to insulate himself from the Airway crowds by trying to\nconstruct new plots for his fiction. In his younger days, of course, he\nhad occupied the time in reading the classics, but lately, so great was\nthe confusion of the city, he preferred to close his eyes, and try to\ndevise a reverse twist for one of his old stories.\n\nToday, he found it harder than usual to concentrate. The Airway was\ncrowded, and he had never heard the people so noisy. Up ahead half a\nblock, there was a sharp scream. Herbert opened his eyes and peered\nahead to see what had happened. Someone had been pushed through the\nrailing of the Airway, and as his section rolled on and passed, he\ncould see lying on the pavement below the body of a young cripple, his\nhands still holding a broken crutch.\n\nHerbert shuddered. He felt sick, and closed his eyes again.\n\n\"Wonder how that happened?\" said the man in front of him.\n\n\"He probably got in the way,\" said a girl, callously.\n\nThe man ahead made no comment, and Herbert dismissed his own\npuzzlement. Could he make a plot out of this incident of the crippled\nboy? he wondered.\n\nHe shifted to the slower track, descended the escalator, and stepped\nonto the street across from the Bureau of Public Entertainment. He had\nto wait a moment, for an ambulance was clanging down the street; then\nhe crossed to the stone-faced building.\n\nAs he rode up the elevator, he wondered again why John had ordered him\nto come to lunch. He realized that he was no longer a young man, but he\ncertainly did not feel ready to be pensioned. And in the last year he\nhad actually written more fiction than in any other year of his life.\nVery little of it had been used, for some reason, but story for story\nhe thought it matched any of his previous output.\n\nLudwig received him with little ceremony. \"Sit down, Herbert. It was\ngood of you to come. Miss Dodson,\" he called through the intercom,\n\"this is strictly off the air. Nothing is to be recorded. Is that\nclear?\"\n\n\"Well, John,\" said Carre. \"You're looking harassed, if I may say\nso. Are they working you too hard? Or are you just faced with the\nunpleasant job of firing an old friend? I realize, of course, that AFE\naren't using much of my stuff just now.\"\n\nLudwig smiled unhappily and shook his head. \"I'm not planning to fire\nyou, Herbert. But you know, of course, that you're in the same boat\nwith the other Writers, and that boat is in choppy waters. Frankly,\nI'm not very happy about the situation. The five-year experimental\nperiod is coming to an end. This Bureau has the job of providing\nentertainment, and that includes, among many other categories,\nliterature. Books, articles, and stories. And I'm faced with a\ndifficult decision: shall we employ Writers, or use Script-Lab? You are\nonly one of the many people we support, of course, and both you and\nScript-Lab furnish material to Adult Fiction, Earth, who distribute it\nas they see fit.\"\n\nHerbert Carre nibbled at his graying moustache. \"I know. And for the\nlast year, for some reason, AFE has not seen fit to use much of my\nstuff. And yet it's no different. I write just the same sort of thing I\nalways did.\"\n\n\"Tastes change, Herbert. Script-Lab reports that the public seem to\nprefer the machine-made stories. I have a week to make a definite\ndecision, and I'm particularly anxious to finish the job because I've\nbeen asked to transfer, at the earliest possible moment, to the Bureau\nof Public Safety. The Committee are inclined, on the whole, to favor\nthe enlarging of Script-Lab, and transferring all the Writers to some\nother department.\"\n\n\"Great Gamma! You mean _all_ literature will be machine-made from now\non?\"\n\n\"Don't get excited, Herb! That's what I've got to decide. But if they\ncan really write it just as well, why not? You remember Hartridge,\ndon't you? Class behind me at college, majored in electronics? He's in\ncharge of the machine experiment and he's about convinced us that his\nmachines can turn out manuscripts at lower cost, more rapidly and of\nbetter quality than you Writers can. And he says the public like his\nproduct better. Have you seen any of it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Carre, \"I don't know that I have. You know I never read\nanything but the classics, for pleasure; nothing later than Thackeray,\nor, at the latest, James Joyce. What principle do they work on?\"\n\n\"I'm not an electronics man. Hartridge tells me they are specially\nsensitive blocks of tubes, and that memory, including all the basic\nplots of fiction, and all the basic varieties of dialog have been built\ninto them.\"\n\nCarre shuddered. \"I will never believe, in the face of any evidence,\nthat machines can take the place of human writers. What machine could\nhave written 'Alice'?\"\n\n\"Calm down, Herbert. I want your help. I haven't followed developments\nsince the days of the early electronic computers, and I haven't time\nfor studying them now. And, unfortunately, I never read modern fiction\nany more--no time for anything but official reports. Now I've always\nrespected your judgment. I want your opinion of the adequacy of the\nmaterial put out by Script-Lab.\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten,\" said Carre, \"that I am a Writer? Aren't you\nafraid of a biased report?\"\n\n\"Not from you. I need a competent judge. And if you are forced to bring\nin a favorable report, you know I'd find you a place in some other\nfield. I might even get you a pension.\"\n\n\"I hope not. Not yet.\"\n\n\"Go over and see Hartridge, look over his machines, and bring me a\ncritical estimate of the quality of their work--not just literary\nquality, of course; we're interested also in entertainment value. Don't\nbe prejudiced. I imagine you'd be the last to deny that writing can be\ndamned hard work.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said Carre. \"I would be the last person to deny it.\nSomehow, I've always liked the work, but if the machines can really\ntake our place, I will try to bow out gracefully.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce again Carre took the escalator to the Airway and moved across the\ncity. He tried to think of fiction plots, but he could not control his\nmind. He was worried. The people standing near him were quarreling,\ntheir shrill voices hurt his ears, and the crowd was so dense that he\ncould not move away.\n\nAge, he feared, was making him irritable. As he approached his station,\nhe pushed towards the escalator. He brushed against a woman who was\nreading a plastibacked book. She looked up, frowned, and then stamped\nviciously on his extended foot. Half-stunned with pain and amazement,\nHerbert managed to get to the escalator, went down, and limped slowly\nthrough the doorway of Computer House. What had possessed the woman? he\nwondered. He'd barely brushed her sleeve, in passing.\n\nHe stood before the door labelled \"Manuscript Laboratory: Dr. Philip\nHartridge,\" and pushed the button. The door opened, but two husky\nguards with pistols in hand blocked his entrance.\n\n\"Your name, please, and your business?\"\n\nHerbert fought a tendency to stammer. His foot still hurt him, he had\ndeveloped a headache, and he felt bewildered.\n\n\"I just want--My name is Herbert Carre and I want to see Dr. Hartridge.\nWhy, we've known each other for years!\"\n\n\"Identification, please?\"\n\nThey examined his identity card and his Bureau papers, and nodded. Then\none returned his pistol to its holster and approached him.\n\n\"Just as a formality, if you please. Dr. Hartridge apologizes for\nthis.\" He ran his hands over Herbert's shabby blouse and trousers, then\nstepped back.\n\n\"That's all, Mr. Carre,\" he said. \"You can go in.\" They preceded him\ninto the reception room, advanced to the rear wall and pushed a series\nof buttons in a complex pattern. A double door, made of metal instead\nof the innocent oak it had seemed to be, slowly swung open.\n\nPhilip Hartridge rose from his desk and extended his hand.\n\n\"Awfully good to see you, Carre,\" he said. \"It must have been nearly\nten years. Sorry you've never come over to see us sooner. We're very\nproud of Script-Lab. How are things?\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" said Herbert. \"I'm still feeling overwhelmed by the\nelaborate protective system you have here. What explains the\nbody-guards? I didn't suppose this laboratory was classified.\"\n\nHartridge leaned back in his chair. \"It's not classified. Those men are\nhere to protect me from possible violence.\"\n\n\"Violence? Great Gamma, do you mean personal threats?\"\n\n\"Yes. Only last week, my 'coptor exploded a few minutes after I started\nthe motor. By a lucky chance, I had gone back to the house to get my\nbrief-case. But someone had certainly tried to kill me.\"\n\n\"Why on earth, Hartridge, should some one--\"\n\n\"It might be one of several people,\" he said. \"But I think it's\nmy brother Ben. He would, of course, like to have my share of the\nmoney our father left us. But I'll take care he doesn't get it.\" He\ngrinned, and patted his hip. \"It's rather more likely to be the other\nway around. But we won't waste time in trivialities, Carre. Ludwig\ncalled me. I know you want to see our set-up here. Come in and see the\nmachines.\"\n\nThey walked through another set of double doors and into the Laboratory.\n\nThe noise was deafening. Twenty enormous machines sat in the room. Each\nwas contained in a dull plastic case, and the control panels were a\nmaze of dials, buttons, and red and green indicator lights. An electric\ntypewriter was connected to and operated by each machine, and through\neach typewriter ran an endless roll of paper, which emerged to be cut\noff into eleven-inch lengths by automatic knives.\n\n\"How do you stand the noise?\" asked Carre. \"Why don't you use Silent\nTypers?\"\n\n\"Oh, the machines don't mind the noise. Silent Typers would be an\nunnecessary expense, and as a matter of fact, I've come to like the\nsound. It's soothing, after a time.\"\n\nCarre strolled slowly, rather mournfully, from one monster to another,\nglancing at the emerging manuscripts.\n\n\"The rate of output,\" said Hartridge, \"is not less than a hundred words\na minute, and they never have to stop to look up their facts, or to\nstruggle with a balky plot. Can you do as well?\"\n\n\"I wish I could,\" said Carre. \"I know so little about electronics. Do\nthe machines use much current?\"\n\n\"No, that's another of their virtues, they're very economical. The\ntubes are so efficient that all twenty machines are run from this one\nsource, right here--Don't touch it! It's not ordinary house current,\nyou know. We start with eight thousand volts,--it saves on metal and\ntransformers.\"\n\nHerbert found it hard to think against the clatter of the typewriters.\n\"I'm ashamed to admit,\" he said, \"that I feel a kind of envy, they\nseem to compose with such ease.\"\n\nHartridge laughed. \"No trouble at all! I tell you, my pretty\ntypewriters are going to put you out of business. You can see for\nyourself, Carre, that there's no need for you human writers. We are\ndoing a perfect job here, and we could supply all the material--novels,\nstories, fact articles, biographies--that the country could read. AFE\nhas been using more and more of our scripts, as you probably know.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"I can't say exactly why it is, but we do seem to be able to hit the\npublic taste better than you Writers.\" He reached over and patted one\nof the plastic cases, as though it had been an affectionate dog.\n\n\"Do your machines do nothing but write new material?\" asked Carre, as\nhe strolled on.\n\n\"That depends on the demand. Sometimes we have a call for some\nout-of-print item, or some work which is so hard to get hold of that\nwe simply have the machines re-do it. After Number Twelve, here,\nproduced the entire English translation of 'War and Peace' without\na single semantic error, we were not afraid to trust them with\nanything. As a matter of fact, we've got Number Eight re-writing some\nnineteenth-century items that have not been available for years--things\nthat were destroyed or banned during the Atomic Wars, but which the\npresent government finds acceptable. Would you like to see?\"\n\nCarre stood in front of Number Eight in fascination as the metal arms\nhammered out the words and lines. After a moment, he frowned. \"I seem\nto remember this! I must have read it in my early boyhood. It seems so\nlong ago. Joan of Arc! But I don't remember its happening just this\nway.\"\n\n\"Just goes to show you can't trust your memory, Carre. You know the\nmachines are perfectly logical, and they can't make a mistake.\"\n\n\"No, of course not. Odd, though.\" He brushed his hand over a forehead\ngrown wet.\n\nThe knife flashed down, cut the paper, and the page fell into its\nbasket. Hartridge picked it up.\n\n\"Would you like this sheet, as a memento? Number Eight can easily re-do\nit.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"And is there anything else I can show you? I don't mind admitting I'm\nvery proud of my machines.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Carre, \"perhaps you might let me have some of your current\nmanuscripts, just for tonight? I can make a comparative study, for\nLudwig, and return them sometime tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Nothing easier.\" He assembled a bundle of stapled sheets and put them\nin a box, and then rang for the guards, to show him out.\n\n\"Take care of yourself, Carre. See you tomorrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHerbert sat, that evening, in his book-lined room, reading manuscripts.\nHe looked more and more puzzled, and ill at ease. He got up, after a\ntime, to pace the room, and on a sudden impulse he left the apartment\nand hurried up the street.\n\nIt had grown dark outside, and he hurried. He could not stand the\nthought of the Airway, so he walked. He had covered nearly half a mile\nwhen, at the corner ahead, two Street-taxis approached each other at\nright angles. The drivers glared at each other. Neither slowed to\nlet the other pass; they crashed, and began to burn. Carre hurried\non, trying not to hear the screams of the people or the siren of the\napproaching ambulance. No wonder, he thought, that they need Ludwig in\nthe Bureau of Public Safety; people were behaving so irrationally!\n\nHe climbed the steps of the City Library, and advanced to the desk.\n\n\"I should like to see files of the magazines published by Adult\nFiction, Earth, if you please.\"\n\n\"But which magazine, sir? They publish hundreds.\"\n\n\"Well, as a start, let me see those which publish light fiction.\"\n\nFor two hours he sat in the Scholar's Room, skimming the pages of the\nmagazines--_Sagebrush Westerns_, _Romance and Marriage_, _Pinkerton's\nOwn_, _Harper's_, and a dozen others. He read with concentration,\nand made few notes. On his way home he stopped at a news-machine and\nselected an armful of the current issues to take home with him. He read\nin his room until nearly dawn, and when he did lie down he could not\nsleep, or rest.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" he whispered to himself. \"It can't be true.\" And,\nhalf an hour later, \"How did it happen?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine next morning he was sitting in the reception room of the Bureau\nof Public Entertainment, with brief-case on his knees, waiting for\nLudwig. It was nearly noon before Ludwig himself arrived, and summoned\nhis visitor.\n\nHe sat at his desk, his white hair rumpled, and nervously fingered his\nwatch chain as Carre took the chair opposite.\n\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting, Herbert. The Commissioners over in Safety\nhave a bad situation to handle, and I've been trying to advise them.\nI'll be glad when this writing business is straightened out, and I can\ngive full attention to Safety. What did you think of Script-Lab?\"\n\n\"Well, it's very efficient.\"\n\n\"I knew that,\" said Ludwig. \"Machines are built to be efficient. But\nwhat do you think of their output? How does it compare with the work of\nthe Writers?\"\n\nCarre cleared his throat. \"John, don't you read the magazines any more?\"\n\n\"No. No time. Do you?\"\n\n\"I haven't, until yesterday. I read them, all night. I hardly know how\nto express myself. John, something is wrong with the machines.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! There can't be anything wrong with them. They're fed the\nplots, fed the variations, and then with perfect logic they create\ntheir stories. You're not an electronics expert, you know.\"\n\nCarre stared at the floor. Ludwig sighed.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Herbert. I'm just too tired to be decently courteous. But\nwhat I wanted from you, after all, was a literary evaluation and not a\nscientific one.\"\n\n\"I express myself so badly. There's something wrong, something I can't\nexactly define, with what they write.\"\n\nLudwig looked exasperated. \"But _what_, man? Be concrete.\"\n\n\"I'll try. Here's a short story that was made yesterday. Glance over\nit, please, and tell me how it strikes you.\"\n\nLudwig read through the manuscript with his accustomed rapidity. \"I\ndon't see anything particularly wrong about it,\" he said. \"Murder\nmysteries have never been to my taste, and I don't know that I exactly\napprove of the hero's killing his benefactress with an undetectable\npoison, and then inheriting her fortune and marrying her niece.\nUndetectable poisons are all nonsense, anyway.\"\n\n\"The story doesn't seem to you--unhealthy?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're getting at! It's on the grim side, I suppose,\nbut isn't most modern fiction a little grim? How about your own stuff?\"\n\n\"I think there's a difference. I know I've written a few mysteries,\nand even some tragic stories, but I don't believe I've ever written\nanything exactly like this. And this is typical. They're doing\nreprints, too, of books that were destroyed or lost during the Atomic\nWars. Do you remember Joan of Arc? Mark Twain's version? Here is a page\nfrom Script-Lab's manuscript.\"\n\nLudwig took the sheet and read aloud: \"By-and-by a frantic man in\npriest's garb came wailing and lamenting and tore through the crowd and\nthe barrier of soldiers and flung himself on his knees by Joan's cart\nand put up his hands in supplication, crying out--\n\n'\"O, forgive, forgive!\"\n\n'It was Loyseleur!\n\n'And Joan's heart knew nothing of forgiveness, nothing of compassion,\nnothing of pity for all that suffer and have been offensive--'\"\n\nLudwig looked up with a frown. \"That's odd. It's been so long since I\nsaw that book--I was only a boy--but that isn't just the way I remember\nit.\"\n\n\"That's what Script-Lab is writing.\"\n\n\"But the machines, don't--\"\n\n\"I know. They don't make mistakes.\"\n\nThe buzz of the visi-sonor interrupted them, and the Commissioner of\nPublic Safety spoke from the screen.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, Ludwig, shelve the book-business and get over\nhere. We've had a rash of robberies with violence, a dozen bad street\naccidents, and two suspicious deaths of diabetics in coma. We need\nhelp.\"\n\nLudwig was already reaching for his brief case. \"Right away,\" he said,\nand flicked the switch.\n\n\"John!\" Carre begged, \"This book matter is serious. You can't just drop\nit! Come with me to Hartridge's lab and see for yourself!\"\n\n\"I can't. No time. You heard the Commissioner.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow morning?\"\n\n\"Can't make it. Have to go to a funeral. A niece of mine who died\nsuddenly of cancer. Poor girl. We thought she was doing so well, too,\nwith the hormone injections. Not that her husband will break his heart,\nfrom what I know of the scoundrel.\"\n\nCarre followed him towards the door. \"Then make it tomorrow afternoon!\nIt's vital!\"\n\nLudwig pulled out his watch, and thought for a second. \"All right. Meet\nyou there tomorrow at three.\" The door slammed behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey followed the guards through the chrome steel doors into the room\nwith the machines. All twenty typewriters were hammering out their\nhundred words a minute.\n\n\"It is an honor to have a visit from you, Commissioner Ludwig,\" said\nHartridge. \"We're very proud of Script-Lab. You'll agree, I know, that\nthe experiment has been eminently successful. Tough on you, of course,\nCarre. But you Writers can always land on your feet.\"\n\n\"The decision has not yet been made,\" said Ludwig. \"Now to business.\"\nHe pulled a chair up to the desk, opened his brief case, and took out\nsome papers.\n\n\"Before I examine the machines, I'd like to check with you the facts\nand figures that Carre has compiled for me. In 1971, the first year of\nthe experiment, only ten per cent of Script-Lab's output of stories,\nbooks, and articles was accepted by Adult Fiction, Earth. Right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Hartridge. \"But that was our worst year. Since then--\"\n\nLudwig held up his hand. \"In the second year, you supplied thirty-five\nper cent of the needs of AFE. Check?\"\n\n\"Check.\"\n\n\"In the two years following you supplied seventy-five per cent, and\nin 1976, this year you are supplying about ninety per cent of all\npublished matter, with the Writers supplying only ten per cent.\nCorrect?\"\n\n\"Correct. A wonderful record, Commissioner.\"\n\nLudwig turned to another sheet of data. \"As I understand it, you feed\ninto the machine's memories, basic plots, factual data, conversational\nvariants, and they do the rest?\"\n\n\"That's right. We give them the material, and they create with perfect\nrationality. I myself read nearly everything they make, and even I am\namazed at their craftsmanship. And they are so efficient, and write so\nswiftly!\"\n\n\"Speed is no doubt a desirable feature,\" said Ludwig.\n\n\"But not the only one!\" said Carre.\n\nHartridge smiled. \"Professional jealously is warping your judgment, old\nman. It may be hard to take, but you Writers have nothing to give the\nworld, anymore, that machines can't.\"\n\nLudwig turned his back and surveyed the room. \"I would like to see,\nnow, some of your productions.\"\n\nHartridge beamed. \"As a matter of fact, I have something that ought to\ninterest you, particularly. Just follow me, gentlemen. Here, by the\nway, is our power source. Note how simple and efficient the circuit\ndesign is. Ah, here we are. Knowing that you were making us a visit\ntoday, I gave to Number Seven, here, the necessary data for creating\nyour own monologue on 'Our Duties to the Aged.' That was your doctoral\nthesis, I believe?\"\n\n\"But that's out of print! I haven't seen a copy myself in years!\"\n\n\"To Script-Lab, that is unimportant. Feed it the data, the basic\npremises, and it will do the rest. Would you like to see?\"\n\nThe three men crowded around Number Seven, and watched the emergence of\npaper from the typewriter as the keys tapped the words into lines, and\nthe carriage shifted. Ludwig, at first, showed only the pleasure which\nany writer feels on re-reading a good piece of work. Gradually, his\nface changed. He looked puzzled, uncertain, and then his skin reddened\nwith anger.\n\n[Illustration: \"_He looked puzzled, uncertain, and then his skin\nreddened with anger._\"]\n\nThe automatic knife chopped down and severed the completed page. Ludwig\nscooped it up from the basket and read the page a second time. He\nraised his eyes to meet the tense gaze of Carre.\n\n\"Is this what you were trying to tell me, Herbert?\"\n\n\"That sort of thing. Yes.\"\n\n\"Is something wrong, Commissioner?\" said Hartridge. \"I thought you'd be\npleased.\"\n\n\"Pleased? But this is something I never wrote!\"\n\n\"But you _must_ have written it,\" said Hartridge. \"Or are you just\ntrying to sabotage my project with a deliberate misstatement?\"\n\n\"Read it!\" said Ludwig. \"Read that paragraph out loud.\"\n\n\"'Our duties to the aged,'\" read Hartridge, \"'are closely bound to our\nduties to ourselves. When the old become infirm, they should be quietly\nhelped out of a contented existence. After all, the only measure of\nthe value of aged men and women should be their present usefulness to\nsociety.'\n\nHe looked up from the page. \"I don't see why you're so unwilling to\nadmit your authorship, Commissioner. There's nothing wrong with this.\"\n\n\"Only,\" Ludwig said softly, \"I didn't write it. What the monologue\nactually said was something like this: 'Our duties to the aged are\nclosely bound to our duties to ourselves. When the old become infirm,\nthey should be quietly helped to a contented existence. After all, the\nonly measure of the value of aged men and women should be their past\nusefulness to our society.'\n\n\"You've made your point, Carre,\" he went on. \"If this sort of perverted\nadvice has been fed to our people the last few years, it's no wonder\nwe're having a wave of crimes. Be selfish! It pays. An eye for an eye!\nPoison the old man! Nobody will ever know and you'll get his money!\"\n\nHartridge was still studying the typescript, and he spoke with\ndefiance. \"Number Seven's excerpt from your monologue seems perfectly\nsensible to me,\" he said. \"For some reason of your own you must be\nlying about it. Why, the version you say you remember is utterly\nillogical!\"\n\n\"Of course it's illogical!\" said Carre. \"Don't you see--\"\n\n\"Of course it's illogical!\" shouted Ludwig. \"It was illogical for Joan\nto forgive her tormentor. It's illogical to take care of invalids. It's\nillogical to forget an injury. But it's human! How on earth is society\nto exist if it feels only the rational emotions? You, yourself,\nHartridge, have been corrupted by reading the work of Script-Lab, and\nyou no longer have any sense of human charity. These monsters have\nbeen undermining our whole life, because the only motivation they were\nprovided was the most dangerous and ugly thing possible in the world of\nhuman beings--pure logic!\"\n\nAs he shouted, he fumbled at his watch, unhooked the long gold chain,\nand with a sudden lunge, flung it across the bus bars which supplied\nthe current to the machines.\n\nThere was a blinding flash, a hiss, and the eternal clacking of the\ntypewriters was replaced by silence.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of What Do You Read?, by Boyd Ellanby"}

At each turn, of course, Seneca mocks the late emperor's personal failings, most notably his arrogant cruelty and his inarticulateness. After Mercury persuades Clotho to kill the emperor, Claudius walks to Mount Olympus, where he convinces Hercules to let the gods hear his suit for deification in a session of the divine senate. Proceedings are in Claudius' favor until Augustus delivers a long and sincere speech listing some of Claudius' most notorious crimes. Most of the speeches of the gods are lost through a large gap in the text. Mercury escorts him to Hades. On the way, they see the funeral procession for the emperor, in which a crew of venal characters mourn the loss of the perpetual Saturnalia of the previous reign. In Hades, Claudius is greeted by the ghosts of all the friends he has murdered. These shades carry him off to be punished, and the doom of the gods is that he should shake dice forever in a box with no bottom (gambling was one of Claudius' vices): every time he tries to throw the dice they fall out and he has to search the ground for them.

The\nmatter will probably continue to be decided by every one according to his\nview of Seneca's character and abilities: in the matters of style and of\nsentiment much may be said on both sides. Dion Cassius (lx, 35) says that\nSeneca composed an [Greek: apokolokuntosis] or Pumpkinification of\nClaudius after his death, the title being a parody of the usual\n[Greek: apotheosis]; but this title is not given in the MSS. of the Ludus\nde Morte Claudii, nor is there anything in the piece which suits the title\nvery well.\n\nAs a literary form, the piece belongs to the class called\n_Satura Menippea_, a satiric medley in prose and verse.\n\nThis text is that of Buecheler, with a few trifling changes, which are\nindicated in the notes.

It\nshall be done without malice or favour. This is the truth. Ask if you like\nhow I know it? To begin with, I am not bound to please you with my answer.\nWho will compel me? I know the same day made me free, which was the last\nday for him who made the proverb true--One must be born either a Pharaoh\nor a fool. If I choose to answer, I will say whatever trips off my tongue.\nWho has ever made the historian produce witness to swear for him? But if\nan authority must be produced, ask of the man who saw Drusilla translated\nto heaven: the same man will aver he saw Claudius on the road, dot and\ncarry one. [Sidenote: Virg. Aen. ii, 724] Will he nill he, all that happens\nin heaven he needs must see. He is the custodian of the Appian Way; by that\nroute, you know, both Tiberius and Augustus went up to the gods. Question\nhim, he will tell you the tale when you are alone; before company he is\ndumb. You see he swore in the Senate that he beheld Drusilla mounting\nheavenwards, and all he got for his good news was that everybody gave him\nthe lie: since when he solemnly swears he will never bear witness again to\nwhat he has seen, not even if he had seen a man murdered in open market.\nWhat he told me I report plain and clear, as I hope for his health and\nhappiness.\n\n  Now had the sun with shorter course drawn in his risen light,           2\n  And by equivalent degrees grew the dark hours of night:\n  Victorious Cynthia now held sway over a wider space,\n  Grim winter drove rich autumn out, and now usurped his place;\n  And now the fiat had gone forth that Bacchus must grow old,\n  The few last clusters of the vine were gathered ere the cold:\n\nI shall make myself better understood, if I say the month was October, the\nday was the thirteenth. What hour it was I cannot certainly tell;\nphilosophers will agree more often than clocks; but it was between midday\nand one after noon. \"Clumsy creature!\" you say. \"The poets are not content\nto describe sunrise and sunset, and now they even disturb the midday\nsiesta. Will you thus neglect so good an hour?\"\n\n  Now the sun's chariot had gone by the middle of his way;\n  Half wearily he shook the reins, nearer to night than day,\n  And led the light along the slope that down before him lay.\n\nClaudius began to breathe his last, and could not                         3\nmake an end of the matter. Then Mercury, who had always been much pleased\nwith his wit, drew aside one of the three Fates, and said: \"Cruel beldame,\nwhy do you let the poor wretch be tormented? After all this torture cannot\nhe have a rest? Four and sixty years it is now since he began to pant for\nbreath. What grudge is this you bear against him and the whole empire? Do\nlet the astrologers tell the truth for once; since he became emperor, they\nhave never let a year pass, never a month, without laying him out for his\nburial. Yet it is no wonder if they are wrong, and no one knows his hour.\nNobody ever believed he was really quite born. [Footnote: A proverb for a\nnobody, as Petron, 58 _qui te natum non putat._] Do what has to be done:\nKill him, and let a better man rule in empty court.\"\n[Sidenote: Virg. Georg iv. 90]\n\nClotho replied: \"Upon my word, I did wish to give him another hour or two,\nuntil he should make Roman citizens of the half dozen who are still\noutsiders. (He made up his mind, you know, to see the whole world in the\ntoga, Greeks, Gauls, Spaniards, Britons, and all.) But since it is your\npleasure to leave a few foreigners for seed, and since you command me, so\nbe it.\" She opened her box and out came three spindles. One was for\nAugurinus, one for Baba, one for Claudius. [Footnote: \"Augurinus\" unknown.\nBaba: see Sep. Ep. 159, a fool.] \"These three,\" she says, \"I will cause to\ndie within one year and at no great distance apart, and I will not dismiss\nhim unattended. Think of all the thousands of men he was wont to see\nfollowing after him, thousands going before, thousands all crowding about\nhim, and it would never do to leave him alone on a sudden. These boon\ncompanions will satisfy him for the nonce.\"\n\n  This said, she twists the thread around his ugly spindle once,          4\n  Snaps off the last bit of the life of that Imperial dunce.\n  But Lachesis, her hair adorned, her tresses neatly bound,\n  Pierian laurel on her locks, her brows with garlands crowned,\n  Plucks me from out the snowy wool new threads as white as snow,\n  Which handled with a happy touch change colour as they go,\n  Not common wool, but golden wire; the Sisters wondering gaze,\n  As age by age the pretty thread runs down the golden days.\n  World without end they spin away, the happy fleeces pull;\n  What joy they take to fill their hands with that delightful wool!\n  Indeed, the task performs itself: no toil the spinners know:\n  Down drops the soft and silken thread as round the spindles go;\n  Fewer than these are Tithon's years, not Nestor's life so long.\n  Phoebus is present: glad he is to sing a merry song;\n  Now helps the work, now full of hope upon the harp doth play;\n  The Sisters listen to the song that charms their toil away.\n  They praise their brother's melodies, and still the spindles run,\n  Till more than man's allotted span the busy hands have spun.\n  Then Phoebus says, \"O sister Fates! I pray take none away,\n  But suffer this one life to be longer than mortal day.\n  Like me in face and lovely grace, like me in voice and song,\n  He'll bid the laws at length speak out that have been dumb so long,\n  Will give unto the weary world years prosperous and bright.\n  Like as the daystar from on high scatters the stars of night,\n  As, when the stars return again, clear Hesper brings his light,\n  Or as the ruddy dawn drives out the dark, and brings the day,\n  As the bright sun looks on the world, and speeds along its way\n  His rising car from morning's gates: so Caesar doth arise,\n  So Nero shows his face to Rome before the people's eyes,\n  His bright and shining countenance illumines all the air,\n  While down upon his graceful neck fall rippling waves of hair.\"\n  Thus Apollo. But Lachesis, quite as ready to cast a\n  favourable eye on a handsome man, spins away by the\n  handful, and bestows years and years upon Nero out\n  of her own pocket. As for Claudius, they tell everybody\n                     to speed him on his way\n         With cries of joy and solemn litany.\n\nAt once he bubbled up the ghost, and there was an end to that shadow of a\nlife. He was listening to a troupe of comedians when he died, so you see I\nhave reason to fear those gentry. The last words he was heard to speak in\nthis world were these. When he had made a great noise with that end of him\nwhich talked easiest, he cried out, \"Oh dear, oh dear! I think I have made\na mess of myself.\" Whether he did or no, I cannot say, but certain it is\nhe always did make a mess of everything.\n\nWhat happened next on earth it is mere waste of                           5\ntime to tell, for you know it all well enough, and there is no fear of your\never forgetting the impression which that public rejoicing made on your\nmemory. No one forgets his own happiness. What happened in heaven you shall\nhear: for proof please apply to my informant. Word comes to Jupiter that a\nstranger had arrived, a man well set up, pretty grey; he seemed to be\nthreatening something, for he wagged his head ceaselessly; he dragged the\nright foot. They asked him what nation he was of; he answered something in\na confused mumbling voice: his language they did not understand. He was no\nGreek and no Roman, nor of any known race. On this Jupiter bids Hercules go\nand find out what country he comes from; you see Hercules had travelled\nover the whole world, and might be expected to know all the nations in it.\nBut Hercules, the first glimpse he got, was really much taken aback,\nalthough not all the monsters in the world could frighten him; when he saw\nthis new kind of object, with its extraordinary gait, and the voice of no\nterrestrial beast, but such as you might hear in the leviathans of the\ndeep, hoarse and inarticulate, he thought his thirteenth labour had come\nupon him. When he looked closer, the thing seemed to be a kind of man.\nUp he goes, then, and says what your Greek finds readiest to his tongue:\n\n  \"Who art thou, and what thy people? Who thy\n  parents, where thy home?\"\n  [Sidenote: Od. i, 17]\n\nClaudius was delighted to find literary men up there, and began to hope\nthere might be some corner for his own historical works. So he caps him\nwith another Homeric verse, explaining that he was Caesar:\n\n  \"Breezes wafted me from Ilion unto the Ciconian land.\"\n  [Sidenote: Od. ix, 39]\n\nBut the next verse was more true, and no less Homeric:\n\n  \"Thither come, I sacked a city, slew the people every one.\"\n\nHe would have taken in poor simple Hercules, but                          6\nthat Our Lady of Malaria was there, who left her temple and came alone with\nhim: all the other gods he had left at Rome. Quoth she, \"The fellow's tale\nis nothing but lies. I have lived with him all these years, and I tell you,\nhe was born at Lyons. You behold a fellow-burgess of Marcus. [Footnote:\nReference unknown.] As I say, he was born at the sixteenth milestone from\nVienne, a native Gaul. So of course he took Rome, as a good Gaul ought to\ndo. I pledge you my word that in Lyons he was born, where Licinus\n[Footnote: A Gallic slave, appointed by Augustus Procurator of Gallia\nLugudunensis, when he made himself notorious by his extortions. See Dion\nCass. liv, 21.] was king so many years. But you that have trudged over more\nroads than any muleteer that plies for hire, you must have come across the\npeople of Lyons, and you must know that it is a far cry from Xanthus to the\nRhone.\" At this point Claudius flared up, and expressed his wrath with as\nbig a growl as he could manage. What he said nobody understood; as a matter\nof fact, he was ordering my lady of Fever to be taken away, and making that\nsign with his trembling hand (which was always steady enough for that, if\nfor nothing else) by which he used to decapitate men. He had ordered her\nhead to be chopped off. For all the notice the others took of him, they\nmight have been his own freedmen.\n\nThen Hercules said, \"You just listen to me, and                           7\nstop playing the fool. You have come to the place where the mice nibble\niron. [Footnote: A proverb, found also in Herondas iii, 76: apparently\nfairy-land, the land of Nowhere.] Out with the truth, and look sharp, or\nI'll knock your quips and quiddities out of you.\" Then to make himself all\nthe more awful, he strikes an attitude and proceeds in his most tragic\nvein:\n\n  \"Declare with speed what spot you claim by birth.\n  Or with this club fall stricken to the earth!\n  This club hath ofttimes slaughtered haughty kings!\n  Why mumble unintelligible things?\n  What land, what tribe produced that shaking head?\n  Declare it! On my journey when I sped\n  Far to the Kingdom of the triple King,\n  And from the Main Hesperian did bring\n  The goodly cattle to the Argive town,\n  There I beheld a mountain looking down\n  Upon two rivers: this the Sun espies\n  Right opposite each day he doth arise.\n  Hence, mighty Rhone, thy rapid torrents flow,\n  And Arar, much in doubt which way to go,\n  Ripples along the banks with shallow roll.\n  Say, is this land the nurse that bred thy soul?\"\n\nThese lines he delivered with much spirit and a bold front. All the same,\nhe was not quite master of his wits, and had some fear of a blow from\nthe fool. Claudius, seeing a mighty man before him, saw things looked\nserious and understood that here he had not quite the same pre-eminence\nas at Rome, where no one was his equal: the Gallic cock was worth most on\nhis own dunghill. So this is what he was thought to say, as far as could\nbe made out: \"I did hope, Hercules, bravest of all the gods, that you\nwould take my part with the rest, and if I should need a voucher, I meant\nto name you who know me so well. Do but call it to mind, how it was I used\nto sit in judgment before your temple whole days together during July and\nAugust. You know what miseries I endured there, in hearing the lawyers\nplead day and night. If you had fallen amongst these, you may think\nyourself very strong, but you would have found it worse than the sewers of\nAugeas: I drained out more filth than you did. But since I want...\"\n\n(Some pages have fallen out, in which Hercules must have been persuaded.\nThe gods are now discussing what Hercules tells them).\n\n\"No wonder you have forced your way into the                              8\nSenate House: no bars or bolts can hold against you. Only do say what\nspecies of god you want the fellow to be made. An Epicurean god he cannot\nbe: for they have no troubles and cause none. A Stoic, then? How can he be\nglobular, as Varro says, without a head or any other projection? There is\nin him something of the Stoic god, as I can see now: he has neither heart\nnor head. Upon my word, if he had asked this boon from Saturn, he would not\nhave got it, though he kept up Saturn's feast all the year round, a truly\nSaturnalian prince. A likely thing he will get it from Jove, whom he\ncondemned for incest as far as in him lay: for he killed his son-in-law\nSilanus, because Silanus had a sister, a most charming girl, called Venus\nby all the world, and he preferred to call her Juno. Why, says he, I want\nto know why, his own sister? Read your books, stupid: you may go half-way\nat Athens, the whole way at Alexandria. Because the mice lick meal at Rome,\nyou say. Is this creature to mend our crooked ways? What goes on in his own\ncloset he knows not;[Footnote: Perhaps alluding to a mock marriage of\nSilius and Messalina.] and now he searches the regions of the sky, wants to\nbe a god. Is it not enough that he has a temple in Britain, that savages\nworship him and pray to him as a god, so that they may find a fool\n[Footnote: Again [GREEK: morou] for [GREEK: theou] as in ch. 6.] to have\nmercy upon them?\"\n\nAt last it came into Jove's head, that while strangers                    9\nwere in the House it was not lawful to speak or debate. \"My lords and\ngentlemen,\" said he, \"I gave you leave to ask questions, and you have made\na regular farmyard [Footnote: Proverb: meaning unknown.] of the place. Be\nso good as to keep the rules of the House. What will this person think of\nus, whoever he is?\" So Claudius was led out, and the first to be asked his\nopinion was Father Janus: he had been made consul elect for the afternoon\nof the next first of July,[Footnote: Perhaps an allusion to the shortening\nof the consul's term, which was done to give more candidates a chance of\nthe honour.] being as shrewd a man as you could find on a summer's day: for\nhe could see, as they say, before and behind. [Footnote 8: II, iii, 109;\nalluding here to Janus's double face.] He made an eloquent harangue,\nbecause his life was passed in the forum, but too fast for the notary to\ntake down. That is why I give no full report of it, for I don't want to\nchange the words he used. He said a great deal of the majesty of the gods,\nand how the honour ought not to be given away to every Tom, Dick, or Harry.\n\"Once,\" said he, \"it was a great thing to become a god; now you have made\nit a farce. Therefore, that you may not think I am speaking against one\nperson instead of the general custom, I propose that from this day forward\nthe godhead be given to none of those who eat the fruits of the earth, or\nwhom mother earth doth nourish. After this bill has been read a third time,\nwhosoever is made, said, or portrayed to be god, I vote he be delivered\nover to the bogies, and at the next public show be flogged with a birch\namongst the new gladiators.\" The next to be asked was Diespiter, son of\nVica Pota, he also being consul elect, and a moneylender; by this trade he\nmade a living, used to sell rights of citizenship in a small way. Hercules\ntrips me up to him daintily, and tweaks him by the ear. So he uttered his\nopinion in these words: \"Inasmuch as the blessed Claudius is akin to the\nblessed Augustus, and also to the blessed Augusta, his grandmother, whom he\nordered to be made a goddess, and whereas he far surpasses all mortal men\nin wisdom, and seeing that it is for the public good that there be some one\nable to join Romulus in devouring boiled turnips, I propose that from this\nday forth blessed Claudius be a god, to enjoy that honour with all its\nappurtenances in as full a degree as any other before him, and that a note\nto that effect be added to Ovid's Metamorphoses.\" The meeting was divided,\nand it looked as though Claudius was to win the day. For Hercules saw his\niron was in the fire, trotted here and trotted there, saying, \"Don't deny\nme; I make a point of the matter. I'll do as much for you again, when you\nlike; you roll my log, and I'll roll yours: one hand washes another.\"\n\nThen arose the blessed Augustus, when his turn                           10\ncame, and spoke with much eloquence. [Footnote: The speech seems to contain\na parody of Augustus's style and sayings.] \"I call you to witness, my lords\nand gentlemen,\" said he, \"that since the day I was made a god I have never\nuttered one word. I always mind my own business. But now I can keep on the\nmask no longer, nor conceal the sorrow which shame makes all the greater.\nIs it for this I have made peace by land and sea? For this have I calmed\nintestine wars? For this, laid a firm foundation of law for Rome, adorned\nit with buildings, and all that--my lords, words fail me; there are none\ncan rise to the height of my indignation. I must borrow that saying of the\neloquent Messala Corvinus, I am ashamed of my authority. [Footnote: M.\nValerius Messala Corvinus, appointed praefectus urbi, resigned within a\nweek.] This man, my lords, who looks as though he could not hurt a fly,\nused to chop off heads as easily as a dog sits down. But why should I speak\nof all those men, and such men? There is no time to lament for public\ndisasters, when one has so many private sorrows to think of. I leave that,\ntherefore, and say only this; for even if my sister knows no Greek, I do:\nThe knee is nearer than the shin. [Footnote: A proverb, like \"Charity\nbegins at home.\" The reading of the passage is uncertain; \"sister\" is only\na conjecture, and it is hard to see why his sister should be mentioned.]\nThis man you see, who for so many years has been masquerading under my\nname, has done me the favour of murdering two Julias, great-granddaughters\nof mine, one by cold steel and one by starvation; and one great grandson,\nL. Silanus--see, Jupiter, whether he had a case against him (at least it is\nyour own if you will be fair.) Come tell me, blessed Claudius, why of all\nthose you killed, both men and women, without a hearing, why you did not\nhear their side of the case first, before putting them to death? Where do\nwe find that custom? It is not done in heaven.\nLook at Jupiter: all these years he has been                             11\nking, and never did more than once to break Vulcan's leg,\n\n  'Whom seizing by the foot he cast from the threshold of the sky,'\n  [Sidenote: Illiad i, 591]\n\nand once he fell in a rage with his wife and strung her up: did he do any\nkilling? You killed Messalina, whose great-uncle I was no less than yours.\n'I don't know,' did you say? Curse you! that is just it: not to know was\nworse than to kill. Caligula he went on persecuting even when he was dead.\nCaligula murdered his father-in-law, Claudius his son-in-law to boot.\nCaligula would not have Crassus' son called Great; Claudius gave him his\nname back, and took away his head. In one family he destroyed Crassus,\nMagnus, Scribonia, the Tristionias, Assario, noble though they were;\nCrassus indeed such a fool that he might have been emperor. Is this he you\nwant now to make a god? Look at his body, born under the wrath of heaven!\nIn fine, let him say the three words [Footnote: Some formula such as _ais\nesse meum_.] quickly, and he may have me for a slave. God! who will worship\nthis god, who will believe in him? While you make gods of such as he, no\none will believe you to be gods. To be brief, my lords: if I have lived\nhonourably among you, if I have never given plain speech to any, avenge my\nwrongs. This is my motion\": then he read out his amendment, which he had\ncommitted to writing: \"Inasmuch as the blessed Claudius murdered his\nfather-in-law Appius Silanus, his two sons-in-law, Pompeius Magnus and L.\nSilanus, Crassus Frugi his daughter's father-in-law, as like him as two\neggs in a basket, Scribonia his daughter's mother-in-law, his wife\nMessalina, and others too numerous to mention; I propose that strong\nmeasures be taken against him, that he be allowed no delay of process, that\nimmediate sentence of banishment be passed on him, that he be deported from\nheaven within thirty days, and from Olympus within thirty hours.\"\n\nThis motion was passed without further debate. Not a moment was lost:\nMercury screwed his neck and haled him to the lower regions, to that bourne\n\"from which they say no traveller returns.\" [Footnote: Catullus iii, 12.]\nAs they passed downwards along the Sacred Way, Mercury asked what was that\ngreat concourse of men? could it be Claudius' funeral? It was certainly a\nmost gorgeous spectacle, got up regardless of expense, clear it was that a\ngod was being borne to the grave: tootling of flutes, roaring of horns, an\nimmense brass band of all sorts, such a din that even Claudius could hear\nit. Joy and rejoicing on every side, the Roman people walking about like\nfree men. Agatho and a few pettifoggers were weeping for grief, and for\nonce in a way they meant it. The Barristers were crawling out of their\ndark corners, pale and thin, with hardly a breath in their bodies, as\nthough just coming to life again. One of them when he saw the pettifoggers\nputting their heads together, and lamenting their sad lot, up comes he and\nsays: \"Did not I tell you the Saturnalia could not last for ever?\"\n\nWhen Claudius saw his own funeral train, he understood that he was dead.\nFor they were chanting his dirge in anapaests, with much mopping and\nmouthing:\n\n  \"Pour forth your laments, your sorrow declare,\n  Let the sounds of grief rise high in the air:\n  For he that is dead had a wit most keen,\n  Was bravest of all that on earth have been.\n  Racehorses are nothing to his swift feet:\n  Rebellious Parthians he did defeat;\n  Swift after the Persians his light shafts go:\n  For he well knew how to fit arrow to bow,\n  Swiftly the striped barbarians fled:\n  With one little wound he shot them dead.\n  And the Britons beyond in their unknown seas,\n  Blue-shielded Brigantians too, all these\n  He chained by the neck as the Romans' slaves.\n  He spake, and the Ocean with trembling waves\n  Accepted the axe of the Roman law.\n  O weep for the man! This world never saw\n  One quicker a troublesome suit to decide,\n  When only one part of the case had been tried,\n  (He could do it indeed and not hear either side).\n  Who'll now sit in judgment the whole year round?\n  Now he that is judge of the shades underground\n  Once ruler of fivescore cities in Crete,\n  Must yield to his better and take a back seat.\n  Mourn, mourn, pettifoggers, ye venal crew,\n  And you, minor poets, woe, woe is to you!\n  And you above all, who get rich quick\n  By the rattle of dice and the three card trick.\"\n\nClaudius was charmed to hear his own praises sung,                       13\nand would have stayed longer to see the show. But the Talthybius\n[Footnote: Talthybius was a herald, and _nuntius_ is obviously a gloss on\nthis. He means Mercury.] of the gods laid a hand on him, and led him across\nthe Campus Martius, first wrapping his head up close that no one might know\nhim, until betwixt Tiber and the Subway he went down to the lower regions.\n[Footnote: By the Cloaca?] His freedman Narcissus had gone down before him\nby a short cut, ready to welcome his master. Out he comes to meet him,\nsmooth and shining (he had just left the bath), and says he: \"What make the\ngods among mortals?\" \"Look alive,\" says Mercury, \"go and tell them we are\ncoming.\" Away he flew, quicker than tongue can tell. It is easy going by\nthat road, all down hill. So although he had a touch of the gout, in a\ntrice they were come to Dis's door. There lay Cerberus, or, as Horace puts\nit, the hundred-headed monster. [Sidenote: Odes ii, 13, 35] Claudius was a\ntrifle perturbed (it was a little white bitch he used to keep for a pet)\nwhen he spied this black shag-haired hound, not at all the kind of thing\nyou could wish to meet in the dark.  In a loud voice he cried, \"Claudius is\ncoming!\" All marched before him singing, \"The lost is found, O let us\nrejoice together!\" [Footnote: With a slight change, a cry used in the\nworship of Osiris.] Here were found C. Silius consul elect, Juncus the\nex-praetor, Sextus Traulus, M. Helvius, Trogus, Cotta, Vettius Valens,\nFabius, Roman Knights whom Narcissus had ordered for execution. In the\nmidst of this chanting company was Mnester the mime, whom Claudius for\nhonour's sake had made shorter by a head. The news was soon blown about\nthat Claudius had come: to Messalina they throng: first his freedmen,\nPolybius, Myron, Harpocras, Amphaeus, Pheronactus, all sent before him by\nClaudius that he might not be unattended anywhere; next two prefects,\nJustus Catonius and Rufrius Pollio; then his friends, Saturninus, Lusius\nand Pedo Pompeius and Lupus and Celer Asinius, these of consular rank; last\ncame his brother's daughter, his sister's daughter, sons-in-law, fathers\nand mothers-in-law, the whole family in fact. In a body they came to meet\nClaudius; and when Claudius saw them, he exclaimed, \"Friends everywhere, on\nmy word! How came you all here?\" To this Pedo Pompeius answered, \"What,\ncruel man? How came we here? Who but you sent us, you, the murderer of all\nthe friends that ever you had? To court with you! I'll show you where their\nlordships sit.\"\n\nPedo brings him before the judgement seat of                             14\nAeacus, who was holding court under the Lex Cornelia to try cases of murder\nand assassination. Pedo requests the judge to take the prisoner's name, and\nproduces a summons with this charge: Senators killed, 35; Roman Knights,\n221; others as the sands of the sea-shore for multitude. [Sidenote:  Il. ix,\n385] Claudius finds no counsel. At length out steps P. Petronius, an old\nchum of his, a finished scholar in the Claudian tongue and claims a remand.\nNot granted. Pedo Pompeius prosecutes with loud outcry. The counsel for the\ndefence tries to reply; but Aeacus, who is the soul of justice, will not\nhave it. Aeacus hears the case against Claudius, refuses to hear the other\nside and passes sentence against him, quoting the line:\n\n  \"As he did, so be he done by, this is justice undefiled.\"\n  [Footnote: A proverbial line.]\n\nA great silence fell. Not a soul but was stupefied at this new way of\nmanaging matters; they had never known anything like it before. It was no\nnew thing to Claudius, yet he thought it unfair. There was a long\ndiscussion as to the punishment he ought to endure. Some said that Sisyphus\nhad done his job of porterage long enough; Tantalus would be dying of\nthirst, if he were not relieved; the drag must be put at last on wretched\nIxion's wheel. But it was determined not to let off any of the old stagers,\nlest Claudius should dare to hope for any such relief. It was agreed that\nsome new punishment must be devised: they must devise some new task,\nsomething senseless, to suggest some craving without result. Then Aeacus\ndecreed he should rattle dice for ever in a box with no bottom. At once the\npoor wretch began his fruitless task of hunting for the dice, which for\never slipped from his fingers.\n\n  \"For when he rattled with the box, and thought he now had got 'em.     15\n  The little cubes would vanish thro' the perforated bottom.\n  Then he would pick 'em up again, and once more set a-trying:\n  The dice but served him the same trick: away they went a-flying.\n  So still he tries, and still he fails; still searching long he lingers;\n  And every time the tricksy things go slipping thro' his fingers.\n  Just so when Sisyphus at last once gets there with his boulder,\n  He finds the labour all in vain--it rolls down off his shoulder.\"\n\nAll on a sudden who should turn up but Caligula, and claims the man for a\nslave: brings witnesses, who said they had seen him being flogged, caned,\nfisticuffed by him. He is handed over to Caligula, and Caligula makes him\na present to Aeacus. Aeacus delivers him to his freedman Menander, to be\nhis law-clerk.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Apocolocyntosis, by Lucius Seneca"}

As he arrives, the narrator notes a thin crack extending from the roof, down the front of the building and into the adjacent lake.\nAlthough Poe wrote this short story before the invention of modern psychological science, Roderick's condition can be described according to its terminology. It includes a form of sensory overload known as hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to textures, light, sounds, smells and tastes), hypochondria (an excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness) and acute anxiety. It is revealed that Roderick's twin sister, Madeline, is also ill and falls into cataleptic, deathlike trances. The narrator is impressed with Roderick's paintings, and attempts to cheer him by reading with him and listening to his improvised musical compositions on the guitar. Roderick sings \"The Haunted Palace\", then tells the narrator that he believes the house he lives in to be alive, and that this sentience arises from the arrangement of the masonry and vegetation surrounding it.\nRoderick later informs the narrator that his sister has died and insists that she be entombed for two weeks in the family tomb located in the house before being permanently buried. The narrator helps Roderick put the body in the tomb, and he notes that Madeline has rosy cheeks, as some do after death. They inter her, but over the next week both Roderick and the narrator find themselves becoming increasingly agitated for no apparent reason. A storm begins. Roderick comes to the narrator's bedroom, which is situated directly above the vault, and throws open his window to the storm. He notices that the tarn surrounding the house seems to glow in the dark, as it glowed in Roderick Usher's paintings, although there is no lightning.\nThe narrator attempts to calm Roderick by reading aloud The Mad Tryst, a novel involving a knight named Ethelred who breaks into a hermit's dwelling in an attempt to escape an approaching storm, only to find a palace of gold guarded by a dragon. He also finds, hanging on the wall, a shield of shining brass on which is written a legend:\nWho entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\nWho slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\nWith a stroke of his mace, Ethelred kills the dragon, who dies with a piercing shriek, and proceeds to take the shield, which falls to the floor with an unnerving clatter.\nAs the narrator reads of the knight's forcible entry into the dwelling, cracking and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow knew that she was alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, in time to see the moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Levent Kurnaz and Jose Menendez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fall of the House of Usher\n\n\n  Son coeur est un luth suspendu;\n  Sitot qu'on le touche il resonne.\n    DE BERANGER.\n\n\n\nDuring the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the\nautumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the\nheavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a\nsingularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself,\nas the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the\nmelancholy House of Usher.  I know not how it was--but, with the\nfirst glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom\npervaded my spirit.  I say insufferable; for the feeling was\nunrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic,\nsentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest\nnatural images of the desolate or terrible.  I looked upon the\nscene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape\nfeatures of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant\neye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white\ntrunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I\ncan compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the\nafter-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into\neveryday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.  There was\nan iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed\ndreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could\ntorture into aught of the sublime.  What was it--I paused to\nthink--what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of\nthe House of Usher?  It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I\ngrapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I\npondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory\nconclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations\nof very simple natural objects which have the power of thus\naffecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among\nconsiderations beyond our depth.  It was possible, I reflected,\nthat a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the\nscene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to\nmodify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful\nimpression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse\nto the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in\nunruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a\nshudder even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and\ninverted images of the grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems,\nand the vacant and eye-like windows.\n\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to\nmyself a sojourn of some weeks.  Its proprietor, Roderick Usher,\nhad been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had\nelapsed since our last meeting.  A letter, however, had lately\nreached me in a distant part of the country--a letter from\nhim--which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no\nother than a personal reply.  The MS gave evidence of nervous\nagitation.  The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental\ndisorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me,\nas his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of\nattempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation\nof his malady.  It was the manner in which all this, and much\nmore, was said--it was the apparent heart that went with his\nrequest--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I\naccordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very\nsingular summons.\n\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet\nI really knew little of my friend.  His reserve had been always\nexcessive and habitual.  I was aware, however, that his very\nancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar\nsensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages,\nin many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in\nrepeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as\nin a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more\nthan to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical\nscience.  I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the\nstem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put\nforth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that\nthe entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had\nalways, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.\nIt was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in\nthought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with\nthe accredited character of the people, and while speculating\nupon the possible influence which the one, in the long\nlapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was\nthis deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent\nundeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with\nthe name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge\nthe original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal\nappellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemed\nto include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the\nfamily and the family mansion.\n\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish\nexperiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to\ndeepen the first singular impression.  There can be no doubt that\nthe consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--for\nwhy should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the\nincrease itself.  Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law\nof all sentiments having terror as a basis.  And it might have\nbeen for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to\nthe house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my\nmind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but\nmention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which\noppressed me.  I had so worked upon my imagination as really to\nbelieve that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an\natmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity--an\natmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but\nwhich had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall,\nand the silent tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull,\nsluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\n\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream,\nI scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.  Its\nprincipal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.\nThe discoloration of ages had been great.  Minute fungi\noverspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work\nfrom the eaves.  Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary\ndilapidation.  No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there\nappeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect\nadaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the\nindividual stones.  In this there was much that reminded me of\nthe specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long\nyears in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the\nbreath of the external air.  Beyond  this indication of\nextensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of\ninstability.  Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might\nhave discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending\nfrom the roof of the building in front, made its way down the\nwall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen\nwaters of the tarn.\n\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the\nhouse.  A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the\nGothic archway of the hall.  A valet, of stealthy step, thence\nconducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate\npassages in my progress to the studio of his master.  Much\nthat I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to\nheighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.\nWhile the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,\nthe sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebony blackness of the\nfloors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as\nI strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had\nbeen accustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to\nacknowledge how familiar was all this--I still wondered to find\nhow unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were\nstirring up.  On one of the staircases, I met the physician of\nthe family.  His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled\nexpression of low cunning and perplexity.  He accosted me with\ntrepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open a door and\nushered me into the presence of his master.\n\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.\nThe windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a\ndistance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible\nfrom within.  Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way\nthrough the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently\ndistinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however,\nstruggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or\nthe recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.  Dark draperies\nhung upon the walls.  The general furniture was profuse,\ncomfortless, antique, and tattered.  Many books and musical\ninstruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality\nto the scene.  I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.\nAn air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and\npervaded all.\n\nUpon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had\nbeen lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth\nwhich had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone\ncordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of\nthe world.  A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me\nof his perfect sincerity.  We sat down; and for some moments,\nwhile he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity,\nhalf of awe.  Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,\nin so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!  It was with\ndifficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the\nman being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.  Yet\nthe character of his face had been at all times remarkable.  A\ncadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous\nbeyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a\nsurpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model,\nbut with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a\nfinely-moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a\nwant of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and\ntenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the\nregions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not\neasily to be forgotten.  And now in the mere exaggeration of the\nprevailing character of these features, and of the expression\nthey were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to\nwhom I spoke.  The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now\nmiraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even\nawed me.  The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all\nunheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather\nthan fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect\nits Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\n\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an\nincoherence--an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise\nfrom a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an\nhabitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation.  For\nsomething of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by\nhis letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and\nby conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation\nand temperament.  His action was alternately vivacious and\nsullen.  His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision\n(when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to\nthat species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty,\nunhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden,\nself-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may\nbe observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of\nopium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.\n\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his\nearnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to\nafford him.  He entered, at some length, into what he conceived\nto be the nature of his malady.  It was, he said, a\nconstitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired\nto find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added,\nwhich would undoubtedly soon pass off.  It displayed itself in a\nhost of unnatural sensations.  Some of these, as he detailed\nthem, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms,\nand the general manner of the narration had their weight.  He\nsuffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most\ninsipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of\ncertain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his\neyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but\npeculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did\nnot inspire him with horror.\n\nTo an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden\nslave.  \"I shall perish,\" said he, \"I must perish in this\ndeplorable folly.  Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be\nlost.  I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but\nin their results.  I shudder at the thought of any, even the most\ntrivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable\nagitation of soul.  I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,\nexcept in its absolute effect--in terror.  In this unnerved--in\nthis pitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner or\nlater arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in\nsome struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.\"\n\nI learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and\nequivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental\ncondition.  He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions\nin regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many\nyears, he had never ventured forth--in regard to an influence\nwhose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here\nto be re-stated--an influence which some peculiarities in the\nmere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by\ndint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an\neffect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets, and\nof the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length,\nbrought about upon the morale of his existence.\n\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of\nthe peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a\nmore natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and\nlong-continued illness--indeed to the evidently approaching\ndissolution--of a tenderly beloved sister--his sole companion for\nlong years--his last and only relative on earth.  \"Her decease,\"\nhe said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \"would leave\nhim (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race\nof the Ushers.\"  While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was\nshe called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the\napartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared.\nI regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with\ndread--and yet I found it impossible to account for such\nfeelings.  A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes\nfollowed her retreating steps.  When a door, at length, closed\nupon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the\ncountenance of the brother--but he had buried his face in his\nhands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary\nwanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which\ntrickled many passionate tears.\n\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill\nof her physicians.  A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of\nthe person, and frequent although transient affections of a\npartially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.\nHitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her\nmalady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the\nclosing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she\nsuccumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible\nagitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I\nlearned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus\nprobably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at least\nwhile living, would be seen by me no more.\n\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either\nUsher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest\nendeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.  We\npainted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to\nthe wild improvisations of his speaking guitar.  And thus, as a\ncloser and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly\ninto the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive\nthe futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which\ndarkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon\nall objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing\nradiation of gloom.\n\nI shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours\nI thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher.  Yet I\nshould fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact\ncharacter of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he\ninvolved me, or led me the way.  An excited and highly\ndistempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all.  His\nlong improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears.  Among\nother things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular\nperversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of\nVon Weber.  From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy\nbrooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vagueness at which\nI shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not\nwhy;--from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before\nme) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion\nwhich should lie within the compass of merely written words.  By\nthe utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he\narrested and overawed attention.  If ever mortal painted an idea,\nthat mortal was Roderick Usher.  For me at least--in the\ncircumstances then surrounding me--there arose out of the pure\nabstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his\ncanvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt\nI ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too\nconcrete reveries of Fuseli.\n\nOne of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend,\npartaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be\nshadowed forth, although feebly, in words.  A small picture\npresented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault\nor tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without\ninterruption or device.  Certain accessory points of the design\nserved well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an\nexceeding depth below the surface of the earth.  No outlet was\nobserved in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch,\nor other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood\nof intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a\nghastly and inappropriate splendour.\n\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory\nnerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with\nthe exception of certain effects of stringed instruments.  It\nwas, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself\nupon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the\nfantastic character of the performances.  But the fervid\nfacility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for.\nThey must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the\nwords of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied\nhimself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that\nintense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have\npreviously alluded as observable only in particular moments of\nthe highest artificial excitement.  The words of one of these\nrhapsodies I have easily remembered.  I was, perhaps, the more\nforcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under\nor mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and\nfor the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of\nthe tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne.  The verses,\nwhich were entitled \"The Haunted Palace,\" ran very nearly, if not\naccurately, thus:\n\n\n                            I.\n\n               In the greenest of our valleys,\n                 By good angels tenanted,\n               Once a fair and stately palace--\n                 Radiant palace--reared its head.\n               In the monarch Thought's dominion--\n                 It stood there!\n               Never seraph spread a pinion\n                 Over fabric half so fair.\n\n\n                           II.\n\n               Banners yellow, glorious, golden,\n                 On its roof did float and flow;\n               (This--all this--was in the olden\n                 Time long ago)\n               And every gentle air that dallied,\n                 In that sweet day,\n               Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,\n                 A winged odour went away.\n\n\n                           III.\n\n               Wanderers in that happy valley\n                 Through two luminous windows saw\n               Spirits moving musically\n                 To a lute's well tuned law,\n               Round about a throne, where sitting\n                 (Porphyrogene!)\n               In state his glory well befitting,\n                 The ruler of the realm was seen.\n\n\n                           IV.\n\n               And all with pearl and ruby glowing\n                 Was the fair palace door,\n               Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing\n                 And sparkling evermore,\n               A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\n                 Was but to sing,\n               In voices of surpassing beauty,\n                 The wit and wisdom of their king.\n\n\n                            V.\n\n               But evil things, in robes of sorrow,\n                 Assailed the monarch's high estate;\n               (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\n                 Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)\n               And, round about his home, the glory\n                 That blushed and bloomed\n               Is but a dim-remembered story,\n                 Of the old time entombed.\n\n\n                           VI.\n\n               And travellers now within that valley,\n                 Through the red-litten windows, see\n               Vast forms that move fantastically\n                 To a discordant melody;\n               While, like a rapid ghastly river,\n                 Through the pale door,\n               A hideous throng rush out forever,\n                 And laugh--but smile no more.\n\n\nI well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad,\nled us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an\nopinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its\nnovelty (for other men* have thought thus,) as on account of the\npertinacity with which he maintained it.  This opinion, in its\ngeneral form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.\nBut, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring\ncharacter, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the\nkingdom of inorganization.  I lack words to express the full\nextent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion.  The\nbelief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with\nthe gray stones of the home of his forefathers.  The conditions\nof the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the\nmethod of collocation of these stones--in the order of their\narrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which\noverspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around--above\nall, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement,\nand in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.  Its\nevidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said,\n(and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain\ncondensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and\nthe walls.  The result was discoverable, he added, in that\nsilent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for\ncenturies had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made\nhim what I now saw him--what he was.  Such opinions need no\ncomment, and I will make none.\n\nOur books--the books which, for years, had formed no small\nportion of the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be\nsupposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm.  We\npored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse\nof Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and\nHell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by\nHolberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indagine,\nand of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of\nTieck; and the City of the Sun by Campanella.  One favourite\nvolume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium\nInquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there\nwere passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs\nand OEgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours.  His\nchief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an\nexceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual of\na forgotten church--the Vigiliae Mortuorum Secundum Chorum Ecclesiae\nMaguntinae.\n\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work,\nand of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one\nevening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was\nno more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a\nfortnight, (previously to its final interment), in one of the\nnumerous vaults within the main walls of the building.  The\nworldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding,\nwas one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute.  The brother\nhad been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration\nof the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of\ncertain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical\nmen, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground\nof the family.  I will not deny that when I called to mind the\nsinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase,\non the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose\nwhat I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an\nunnatural, precaution.\n\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the\narrangements for the temporary entombment.  The body having been\nencoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest.  The vault in which\nwe placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our\ntorches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us\nlittle opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and\nentirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great\ndepth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which\nwas my own sleeping apartment.  It had been used, apparently, in\nremote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and,\nin later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other\nhighly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,\nand the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached\nit, were carefully sheathed with copper.  The door, of massive\niron, had been, also, similarly protected.  Its immense weight\ncaused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\n\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within\nthis region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet\nunscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the\ntenant.  A striking similitude between the brother and sister now\nfirst arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my\nthoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that\nthe deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a\nscarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them.\nOur glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could\nnot regard her unawed.  The disease which had thus entombed the\nlady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies\nof a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint\nblush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously\nlingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.  We\nreplaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door\nof iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy\napartments of the upper portion of the house.\n\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an\nobservable change came over the features of the mental disorder\nof my friend.  His ordinary manner had vanished.  His ordinary\noccupations were neglected or forgotten.  He roamed from chamber\nto chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.  The\npallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more\nghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone\nout.  The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no\nmore; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually\ncharacterized his utterance.  There were times, indeed, when I\nthought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some\noppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the\nnecessary courage.  At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all\ninto the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him\ngazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the\nprofoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary\nsound.  It was no wonder that his condition terrified--that it\ninfected me.  I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain\ndegrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive\nsuperstitions.\n\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night\nof the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady\nMadeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of\nsuch feelings.  Sleep came not near my couch--while the hours\nwaned and waned away.  I struggled to reason off the nervousness\nwhich had dominion over me.  I endeavoured to believe that much,\nif not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence\nof the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered\ndraperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising\ntempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled\nuneasily about the decorations of the bed.  But my efforts were\nfruitless.  An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame;\nand, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of\nutterly causeless alarm.  Shaking this off with a gasp and a\nstruggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering\nearnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened--I\nknow not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me--to\ncertain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses\nof the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.  Overpowered\nby an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable,\nI threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep\nno more during the night,) and endeavoured to arouse myself from\nthe pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly\nto and fro through the apartment.\n\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step\non an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.  I presently\nrecognized it as that of Usher.  In an instant afterwards he\nrapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a\nlamp.  His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan--but,\nmoreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes--an\nevidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour.  His\nair appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude\nwhich I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as\na relief.\n\n\"And you have not seen it?\" he said abruptly, after having\nstared about him for some moments in silence--\"you have\nnot then seen it?--but, stay! you shall.\"  Thus speaking, and\nhaving carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the\ncasements, and threw it freely open to the storm.\n\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us\nfrom our feet.  It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly\nbeautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its\nbeauty.  A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our\nvicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the\ndirection of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds\n(which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did\nnot prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they\nflew careering from all points against each other, without\npassing away into the distance.  I say that even their exceeding\ndensity did not prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no\nglimpse of the moon or stars--nor was there any flashing forth of\nthe lightning.  But the under surfaces of the huge masses of\nagitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately\naround us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly\nluminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung\nabout and enshrouded the mansion.\n\n\"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I,\nshudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence,\nfrom the window to a seat.  \"These appearances, which bewilder\nyou, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon--or it may be\nthat they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the\ntarn.  Let us close this casement;--the air is chilling and\ndangerous to your frame.  Here is one of your favourite romances.\nI will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass away this\nterrible night together.\"\n\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the \"Mad\nTrist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite\nof Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there\nis little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could\nhave had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my\nfriend.  It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and\nI indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated\nthe hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental\ndisorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of\nthe folly which I should read.  Could I have judged, indeed, by\nthe wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he\nhearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I\nmight well have congratulated myself upon the success of my\ndesign.\n\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where\nEthelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for\npeaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to\nmake good an entrance by force.  Here, it will be remembered, the\nwords of the narrative run thus:\n\n\"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who\nwas now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine\nwhich he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the\nhermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn,\nbut, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising\nof the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made\nquickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted\nhand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and\nripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and\nhollow-sounding wood alarmed and reverberated throughout the\nforest.\"\n\nAt the termination of this sentence I started, and for a\nmoment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once\nconcluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to\nme that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there\ncame, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its\nexact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull\none certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir\nLauncelot had so particularly described.  It was, beyond doubt,\nthe coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid\nthe rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary\ncommingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in\nitself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or\ndisturbed me.  I continued the story:\n\n\"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the\ndoor, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the\nmaliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly\nand prodigious demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which sat in\nguard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon\nthe wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend\nenwritten--\n\n     Who entereth herein, a conquerer hath bin;\n     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\n\nand Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the\ndragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with\na shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that\nEthelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the\ndreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\"\n\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild\namazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this\ninstance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it\nproceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently\ndistant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or\ngrating sound--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already\nconjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the\nromancer.\n\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the\nsecond and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand\nconflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were\npredominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to\navoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of\nmy companion.  I was by no means certain that he had noticed the\nsounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration\nhad, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour.\nFrom a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round\nhis chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber;\nand thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I\nsaw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.\nHis head had dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not\nasleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a\nglance of it in profile.  The motion of his body, too, was at\nvariance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with a\ngentle yet constant and uniform sway.  Having rapidly taken\nnotice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot,\nwhich thus proceeded:\n\n\"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible\nfury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and\nof the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed\nthe carcass from out of the way before him, and approached\nvalorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where\nthe shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his\nfull coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor,\nwith a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\"\n\nNo sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a\nshield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a\nfloor of silver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic,\nand clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation.  Completely\nunnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement\nof Usher was undisturbed.  I rushed to the chair in which he sat.\nHis eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole\ncountenance there reigned a stony rigidity.  But, as I placed my\nhand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his\nwhole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw\nthat he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if\nunconscious of my presence.  Bending closely over him, I at\nlength drank in the hideous import of his words.\n\n\"Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and have heard it.\nLong--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard\nit--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I\ndared not--I dared not speak!  We have put her living in\nthe tomb!  Said I not that my senses were acute?  I now tell\nyou that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin.\nI heard them--many, many days ago--yet I dared not--I dared\nnot speak!  And now--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking\nof the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the\nclangour of the shield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin,\nand the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her\nstruggles within the coppered archway of the vault!  Oh whither\nshall I fly?  Will she not be here anon?  Is she not hurrying to\nupbraid me for my haste?  Have I not heard her footsteps on the\nstair?  Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of\nher heart?  Madman!\" here he sprang furiously to his feet, and\nshrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up\nhis soul--\"Madman!  I tell you that she now stands without the\ndoor!\"\n\nAs if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had\nbeen found the potency of a spell--the huge antique panels to\nwhich the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant,\ntheir ponderous and ebony jaws.  It was the work of the\nrushing gust--but then without those doors there DID stand the\nlofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.  There\nwas blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter\nstruggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame.  For a moment\nshe remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold,--then,\nwith a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person\nof her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies,\nbore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he\nhad anticipated.\n\nFrom that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.\nThe storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself\ncrossing the old causeway.  Suddenly there shot along the path a\nwild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could\nhave issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind\nme.  The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red\nmoon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible\nfissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof\nof the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base.  While I\ngazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath\nof the whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once\nupon my sight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing\nasunder--there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the\nvoice of a thousand waters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet\nclosed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the \"House of\nUsher\".\n\n\n* Watson, Dr Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of Landaff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Fall of the House of Usher, by Edgar Allan Poe"}
{"doc_id": "47b4955fca17af174e1a45b7ff981ce68f3625f8", "token_count": 18665, "summary": " Early in the 21st century, nearly twenty years after the invention of atomic power and ten years after the first lunar landing, the four-man crew of the Ares has landed on Mars in the Mare Cimmerium. A week after the landing, Dick Jarvis, the ship's American chemist, sets out south in an auxiliary rocket to photograph the landscape. Eight hundred miles out, the engine on Jarvis' rocket gives out, and he crash-lands into one of the Thyle regions. Rather than sit and wait for rescue, Jarvis decides to walk back north to the Ares. Just after crossing into the Mare Chronium, Jarvis comes across a tentacled Martian creature attacking a large birdlike creature. He notices that the birdlike Martian is carrying a bag around its neck, and recognizing it as an intelligent being, saves it from the tentacled monstrosity. The rescued creature refers to itself as Tweel. Tweel accompanies Jarvis on his trip back to the Ares, in the course of which it manages to pick up some English, although Jarvis is unable to make any sense of Tweel's language. At first, Tweel travels in tremendous, city-block-long leaps that end with its long beak buried in the ground, but upon seeing Jarvis trudge along, walks beside him.\nUpon reaching Xanthus, a desert region outside the Mare Cimmerium, Jarvis and Tweel find a line of small pyramids tens of thousands of years old made of silica bricks, each open at the top. As they follow the line, the pyramids slowly become larger and newer. By the time the pyramids are ten feet high, the travelers reach the end of the line and find a pyramid that is not open at the top. As they watch, a creature with gray scales, one arm, a mouth and a pointed tail pushes its way out of the top of the pyramid, pulls itself several yards along the ground, then plants itself in the ground by the tail. It starts exhaling bricks from its mouth at ten-minute intervals and using them to build another pyramid around itself. Jarvis realizes that the creature is silicon-based rather than carbon-based; neither animal, vegetable nor mineral, but a little of each. The strange combination of a creature produces the solid substance silica and builds itself in with the by-product, then sleeps for an unknown length of time.\nAs the two approach a canal cutting across Xanthus, Jarvis is feeling homesick for New York City, thinking about Fancy Long, a woman he knows from the cast of the Yerba Mate Hour show. When he sees Long standing by the canal, he begins to approach her, but is stopped by Tweel. Tweel takes out a gun that fires poisoned glass needles and shoots Long, who vanishes, replaced by one of the tentacled creatures that Jarvis rescued Tweel from at their first meeting. Jarvis realizes that the tentacled creature, which he names a dream-beast, lures its prey by projecting illusions into their minds.\nAs Jarvis and Tweel approach a city on the canal bank, they are passed by a barrel-like creature with four legs, four arms, and a circle of eyes around its waist. The barrel creature is pushing an empty, coppery cart; it pays no attention to Jarvis and Tweel as it goes by them. Another goes by, then a third. Jarvis stands in front of the third, which stops. Jarvis says, \"We are friends,\" and the cart creature repeats the phrase from a diaphragm atop its body, \"We are v-r-r-riends,\" before pushing past him. The next cart creature repeats the phrase as it goes by, and the next.\nEventually the cart creatures start returning to the city with their carts full of stones, sand, and chunks of rubbery plants. Jarvis stands in front of one and refuses to move. The cart creature tweaks his nose hard enough to make him jump aside and yell \"Ouch\". After that, every cart creature that passes by says \"We are v-r-r-riends! Ouch!\"\nJarvis and Tweel follow the cart creatures to their destination, a mound with a tunnel leading down below it. Jarvis soon becomes lost in the network of tunnels, and hours or days pass before he and Tweel find themselves in a domed chamber near the surface. There they find the cart creatures depositing their loads beneath a wheel that grinds the stones and plants into dust. Some of the cart creatures also step under the wheel themselves and are pulverized. Beyond the wheel is a shining crystal on a pedestal. When Jarvis approaches it he feels a tingling in his hands and face, and a wart on his left thumb dries up and falls off. He speculates that the crystal emits some form of radiation that destroys diseased tissue but leaves healthy tissue unharmed.\nThe cart creatures suddenly begin attacking Jarvis and Tweel, who retreat up a corridor which fortunately leads outside. The cart creatures corner them and, rather than save himself, Tweel stays by Jarvis' side facing certain death. The cart creatures are about to finish them off when an auxiliary rocket from the Ares lands, destroying the creatures. Jarvis boards the rocket while Tweel bounds away into the Martian horizon. The rocket returns with Jarvis to the Ares, and he tells his story to the other three. Jarvis is preoccupied with recalling the friendship and bond between Tweel and himself when Captain Harrison expresses regret that they do not have the healing crystal. Jarvis, his mind somewhere else, admits that the cart creatures were attacking him because he took it; he takes it out and shows it to the others.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK A MARTIAN ODYSSEY ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Joel Schlosberg and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nThis eBook was produced from the 1949 book _A Martian Odyssey and\nOthers_ by Stanley G. Weinbaum, pp. 1-27. Extensive research did not\nuncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was\nrenewed.\n\n\n\n\nA MARTIAN ODYSSEY\n\n\nJarvis stretched himself as luxuriously as he could in the cramped\ngeneral quarters of the _Ares_.\n\n\"Air you can breathe!\" he exulted. \"It feels as thick as soup after the\nthin stuff out there!\" He nodded at the Martian landscape stretching\nflat and desolate in the light of the nearer moon, beyond the glass of\nthe port.\n\nThe other three stared at him sympathetically--Putz, the engineer,\nLeroy, the biologist, and Harrison, the astronomer and captain of the\nexpedition. Dick Jarvis was chemist of the famous crew, the _Ares_\nexpedition, first human beings to set foot on the mysterious neighbor of\nthe earth, the planet Mars. This, of course, was in the old days, less\nthan twenty years after the mad American Doheny perfected the atomic\nblast at the cost of his life, and only a decade after the equally mad\nCardoza rode on it to the moon. They were true pioneers, these four of\nthe _Ares_. Except for a half-dozen moon expeditions and the ill-fated\nde Lancey flight aimed at the seductive orb of Venus, they were the\nfirst men to feel other gravity than earth's, and certainly the first\nsuccessful crew to leave the earth-moon system. And they deserved that\nsuccess when one considers the difficulties and discomforts--the months\nspent in acclimatization chambers back on earth, learning to breathe the\nair as tenuous as that of Mars, the challenging of the void in the tiny\nrocket driven by the cranky reaction motors of the twenty-first century,\nand mostly the facing of an absolutely unknown world.\n\nJarvis stretched and fingered the raw and peeling tip of his\nfrost-bitten nose. He sighed again contentedly.\n\n\"Well,\" exploded Harrison abruptly, \"are we going to hear what happened?\nYou set out all shipshape in an auxiliary rocket, we don't get a peep\nfor ten days, and finally Putz here picks you out of a lunatic ant-heap\nwith a freak ostrich as your pal! Spill it, man!\"\n\n\"Speel?\" queried Leroy perplexedly. \"Speel what?\"\n\n\"He means '_spiel_',\" explained Putz soberly. \"It iss to tell.\"\n\nJarvis met Harrison's amused glance without the shadow of a smile.\n\"That's right, Karl,\" he said in grave agreement with Putz. \"_Ich spiel\nes!_\" He grunted comfortably and began.\n\n\"According to orders,\" he said, \"I watched Karl here take off toward the\nNorth, and then I got into my flying sweat-box and headed South. You'll\nremember, Cap--we had orders not to land, but just scout about for\npoints of interest. I set the two cameras clicking and buzzed along,\nriding pretty high--about two thousand feet--for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, it gave the cameras a greater field, and second, the under-jets\ntravel so far in this half-vacuum they call air here that they stir up\ndust if you move low.\"\n\n\"We know all that from Putz,\" grunted Harrison. \"I wish you'd saved the\nfilms, though. They'd have paid the cost of this junket; remember how\nthe public mobbed the first moon pictures?\"\n\n\"The films are safe,\" retorted Jarvis. \"Well,\" he resumed, \"as I said, I\nbuzzed along at a pretty good clip; just as we figured, the wings\nhaven't much lift in this air at less than a hundred miles per hour, and\neven then I had to use the under-jets.\n\n\"So, with the speed and the altitude and the blurring caused by the\nunder-jets, the seeing wasn't any too good. I could see enough, though,\nto distinguish that what I sailed over was just more of this grey plain\nthat we'd been examining the whole week since our landing--same blobby\ngrowths and the same eternal carpet of crawling little plant-animals, or\nbiopods, as Leroy calls them. So I sailed along, calling back my\nposition every hour as instructed, and not knowing whether you heard\nme.\"\n\n\"I did!\" snapped Harrison.\n\n\"A hundred and fifty miles south,\" continued Jarvis imperturbably, \"the\nsurface changed to a sort of low plateau, nothing but desert and\norange-tinted sand. I figured that we were right in our guess, then,\nand this grey plain we dropped on was really the Mare Cimmerium which\nwould make my orange desert the region called Xanthus. If I were right,\nI ought to hit another grey plain, the Mare Chronium in another couple\nof hundred miles, and then another orange desert, Thyle I or II. And so\nI did.\"\n\n\"Putz verified our position a week and a half ago!\" grumbled the\ncaptain. \"Let's get to the point.\"\n\n\"Coming!\" remarked Jarvis. \"Twenty miles into Thyle--believe it or\nnot--I crossed a canal!\"\n\n\"Putz photographed a hundred! Let's hear something new!\"\n\n\"And did he also see a city?\"\n\n\"Twenty of 'em, if you call those heaps of mud cities!\"\n\n\"Well,\" observed Jarvis, \"from here on I'll be telling a few things Putz\ndidn't see!\" He rubbed his tingling nose, and continued. \"I knew that I\nhad sixteen hours of daylight at this season, so eight hours--eight\nhundred miles--from here, I decided to turn back. I was still over\nThyle, whether I or II I'm not sure, not more than twenty-five miles\ninto it. And right there, Putz's pet motor quit!\"\n\n\"Quit? How?\" Putz was solicitous.\n\n\"The atomic blast got weak. I started losing altitude right away, and\nsuddenly there I was with a thump right in the middle of Thyle! Smashed\nmy nose on the window, too!\" He rubbed the injured member ruefully.\n\n\"Did you maybe try vashing der combustion chamber mit acid sulphuric?\"\ninquired Putz. \"Sometimes der lead giffs a secondary radiation--\"\n\n\"Naw!\" said Jarvis disgustedly. \"I wouldn't try that, of course--not\nmore than ten times! Besides, the bump flattened the landing gear and\nbusted off the under-jets. Suppose I got the thing working--what then?\nTen miles with the blast coming right out of the bottom and I'd have\nmelted the floor from under me!\" He rubbed his nose again. \"Lucky for me\na pound only weighs seven ounces here, or I'd have been mashed flat!\"\n\n\"I could have fixed!\" ejaculated the engineer. \"I bet it vas not\nserious.\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" agreed Jarvis sarcastically. \"Only it wouldn't fly.\nNothing serious, but I had my choice of waiting to be picked up or\ntrying to walk back--eight hundred miles, and perhaps twenty days before\nwe had to leave! Forty miles a day! Well,\" he concluded, \"I chose to\nwalk. Just as much chance of being picked up, and it kept me busy.\"\n\n\"We'd have found you,\" said Harrison.\n\n\"No doubt. Anyway, I rigged up a harness from some seat straps, and put\nthe water tank on my back, took a cartridge belt and revolver, and some\niron rations, and started out.\"\n\n\"Water tank!\" exclaimed the little biologist, Leroy. \"She weigh\none-quarter ton!\"\n\n\"Wasn't full. Weighed about two hundred and fifty pounds earth-weight,\nwhich is eighty-five here. Then, besides, my own personal two hundred\nand ten pounds is only seventy on Mars, so, tank and all, I grossed a\nhundred and fifty-five, or fifty-five pounds less than my everyday\nearth-weight. I figured on that when I undertook the forty-mile daily\nstroll. Oh--of course I took a thermo-skin sleeping bag for these wintry\nMartian nights.\n\n\"Off I went, bouncing along pretty quickly. Eight hours of daylight\nmeant twenty miles or more. It got tiresome, of course--plugging along\nover a soft sand desert with nothing to see, not even Leroy's crawling\nbiopods. But an hour or so brought me to the canal--just a dry ditch\nabout four hundred feet wide, and straight as a railroad on its own\ncompany map.\n\n\"There'd been water in it sometime, though. The ditch was covered with\nwhat looked like a nice green lawn. Only, as I approached, the lawn\nmoved out of my way!\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Leroy.\n\n\"Yeah, it was a relative of your biopods. I caught one--a little\ngrass-like blade about as long as my finger, with two thin, stemmy\nlegs.\"\n\n\"He is where?\" Leroy was eager.\n\n\"He is let go! I had to move, so I plowed along with the walking grass\nopening in front and closing behind. And then I was out on the orange\ndesert of Thyle again.\n\n\"I plugged steadily along, cussing the sand that made going so tiresome,\nand, incidentally, cussing that cranky motor of yours, Karl. It was just\nbefore twilight that I reached the edge of Thyle, and looked down over\nthe gray Mare Chronium. And I knew there was seventy-five miles of\n_that_ to be walked over, and then a couple of hundred miles of that\nXanthus desert, and about as much more Mare Cimmerium. Was I pleased? I\nstarted cussing you fellows for not picking me up!\"\n\n\"We were trying, you sap!\" said Harrison.\n\n\"That didn't help. Well, I figured I might as well use what was left of\ndaylight in getting down the cliff that bounded Thyle. I found an easy\nplace, and down I went. Mare Chronium was just the same sort of place as\nthis--crazy leafless plants and a bunch of crawlers; I gave it a glance\nand hauled out my sleeping bag. Up to that time, you know, I hadn't seen\nanything worth worrying about on this half-dead world--nothing\ndangerous, that is.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" queried Harrison.\n\n\"_Did I!_ You'll hear about it when I come to it. Well, I was just about\nto turn in when suddenly I heard the wildest sort of shenanigans!\"\n\n\"Vot iss shenanigans?\" inquired Putz.\n\n\"He says, 'Je ne sais quoi,'\" explained Leroy. \"It is to say, 'I don't\nknow what.'\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Jarvis. \"I didn't know what, so I sneaked over to\nfind out. There was a racket like a flock of crows eating a bunch of\ncanaries--whistles, cackles, caws, trills, and what have you. I rounded\na clump of stumps, and there was Tweel!\"\n\n\"Tweel?\" said Harrison, and \"Tveel?\" said Leroy and Putz.\n\n\"That freak ostrich,\" explained the narrator. \"At least, Tweel is as\nnear as I can pronounce it without sputtering. He called it something\nlike 'Trrrweerrlll.'\"\n\n\"What was he doing?\" asked the Captain.\n\n\"He was being eaten! And squealing, of course, as any one would.\"\n\n\"Eaten! By what?\"\n\n\"I found out later. All I could see then was a bunch of black ropy arms\ntangled around what looked like, as Putz described it to you, an\nostrich. I wasn't going to interfere, naturally; if both creatures were\ndangerous, I'd have one less to worry about.\n\n\"But the bird-like thing was putting up a good battle, dealing vicious\nblows with an eighteen-inch beak, between screeches. And besides, I\ncaught a glimpse or two of what was on the end of those arms!\" Jarvis\nshuddered. \"But the clincher was when I noticed a little black bag or\ncase hung about the neck of the bird-thing! It was intelligent! That or\ntame, I assumed. Anyway, it clinched my decision. I pulled out my\nautomatic and fired into what I could see of its antagonist.\n\n\"There was a flurry of tentacles and a spurt of black corruption, and\nthen the thing, with a disgusting sucking noise, pulled itself and its\narms into a hole in the ground. The other let out a series of clacks,\nstaggered around on legs about as thick as golf sticks, and turned\nsuddenly to face me. I held my weapon ready, and the two of us stared at\neach other.\n\n\"The Martian wasn't a bird, really. It wasn't even bird-like, except\njust at first glance. It had a beak all right, and a few feathery\nappendages, but the beak wasn't really a beak. It was somewhat flexible;\nI could see the tip bend slowly from side to side; it was almost like a\ncross between a beak and a trunk. It had four-toed feet, and four\nfingered things--hands, you'd have to call them, and a little roundish\nbody, and a long neck ending in a tiny head--and that beak. It stood an\ninch or so taller than I, and--well, Putz saw it!\"\n\nThe engineer nodded. \"_Ja!_ I saw!\"\n\nJarvis continued. \"So--we stared at each other. Finally the creature\nwent into a series of clackings and twitterings and held out its hands\ntoward me, empty. I took that as a gesture of friendship.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" suggested Harrison, \"it looked at that nose of yours and\nthought you were its brother!\"\n\n\"Huh! You can be funny without talking! Anyway, I put up my gun and said\n'Aw, don't mention it,' or something of the sort, and the thing came\nover and we were pals.\n\n\"By that time, the sun was pretty low and I knew that I'd better build a\nfire or get into my thermo-skin. I decided on the fire. I picked a spot\nat the base of the Thyle cliff, where the rock could reflect a little\nheat on my back. I started breaking off chunks of this desiccated\nMartian vegetation, and my companion caught the idea and brought in an\narmful. I reached for a match, but the Martian fished into his pouch and\nbrought out something that looked like a glowing coal; one touch of it,\nand the fire was blazing--and you all know what a job we have starting a\nfire in this atmosphere!\n\n\"And that bag of his!\" continued the narrator. \"That was a manufactured\narticle, my friends; press an end and she popped open--press the middle\nand she sealed so perfectly you couldn't see the line. Better than\nzippers.\n\n\"Well, we stared at the fire a while and I decided to attempt some sort\nof communication with the Martian. I pointed at myself and said 'Dick';\nhe caught the drift immediately, stretched a bony claw at me and\nrepeated 'Tick.' Then I pointed at him, and he gave that whistle I\ncalled Tweel; I can't imitate his accent. Things were going smoothly; to\nemphasize the names, I repeated 'Dick,' and then, pointing at him,\n'Tweel.'\n\n\"There we stuck! He gave some clacks that sounded negative, and said\nsomething like 'P-p-p-proot.' And that was just the beginning; I was\nalways 'Tick,' but as for him--part of the time he was 'Tweel,' and part\nof the time he was 'P-p-p-proot,' and part of the time he was sixteen\nother noises!\n\n\"We just couldn't connect. I tried 'rock,' and I tried 'star,' and\n'tree,' and 'fire,' and Lord knows what else, and try as I would, I\ncouldn't get a single word! Nothing was the same for two successive\nminutes, and if that's a language, I'm an alchemist! Finally I gave it\nup and called him Tweel, and that seemed to do.\n\n\"But Tweel hung on to some of my words. He remembered a couple of them,\nwhich I suppose is a great achievement if you're used to a language you\nhave to make up as you go along. But I couldn't get the hang of his\ntalk; either I missed some subtle point or we just didn't _think_\nalike--and I rather believe the latter view.\n\n\"I've other reasons for believing that. After a while I gave up the\nlanguage business, and tried mathematics. I scratched two plus two\nequals four on the ground, and demonstrated it with pebbles. Again Tweel\ncaught the idea, and informed me that three plus three equals six. Once\nmore we seemed to be getting somewhere.\n\n\"So, knowing that Tweel had at least a grammar school education, I drew\na circle for the sun, pointing first at it, and then at the last glow of\nthe sun. Then I sketched in Mercury, and Venus, and Mother Earth, and\nMars, and finally, pointing to Mars, I swept my hand around in a sort of\ninclusive gesture to indicate that Mars was our current environment. I\nwas working up to putting over the idea that my home was on the earth.\n\n\"Tweel understood my diagram all right. He poked his beak at it, and\nwith a great deal of trilling and clucking, he added Deimos and Phobos\nto Mars, and then sketched in the earth's moon!\n\n\"Do you see what that proves? It proves that Tweel's race uses\ntelescopes--that they're civilized!\"\n\n\"Does not!\" snapped Harrison. \"The moon is visible from here as a fifth\nmagnitude star. They could see its revolution with the naked eye.\"\n\n\"The moon, yes!\" said Jarvis. \"You've missed my point. Mercury isn't\nvisible! And Tweel knew of Mercury because he placed the Moon at the\n_third_ planet, not the second. If he didn't know Mercury, he'd put the\nearth second, and Mars third, instead of fourth! See?\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Harrison.\n\n\"Anyway,\" proceeded Jarvis, \"I went on with my lesson. Things were going\nsmoothly, and it looked as if I could put the idea over. I pointed at\nthe earth on my diagram, and then at myself, and then, to clinch it, I\npointed to myself and then to the earth itself shining bright green\nalmost at the zenith.\n\n\"Tweel set up such an excited clacking that I was certain he understood.\nHe jumped up and down, and suddenly he pointed at himself and then at\nthe sky, and then at himself and at the sky again. He pointed at his\nmiddle and then at Arcturus, at his head and then at Spica, at his feet\nand then at half a dozen stars, while I just gaped at him. Then, all of\na sudden, he gave a tremendous leap. Man, what a hop! He shot straight\nup into the starlight, seventy-five feet if an inch! I saw him\nsilhouetted against the sky, saw him turn and come down at me head\nfirst, and land smack on his beak like a javelin! There he stuck square\nin the center of my sun-circle in the sand--a bull's eye!\"\n\n\"Nuts!\" observed the captain. \"Plain nuts!\"\n\n\"That's what I thought, too! I just stared at him open-mouthed while he\npulled his head out of the sand and stood up. Then I figured he'd missed\nmy point, and I went through the whole blamed rigamarole again, and it\nended the same way, with Tweel on his nose in the middle of my picture!\"\n\n\"Maybe it's a religious rite,\" suggested Harrison.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Jarvis dubiously. \"Well, there we were. We could exchange\nideas up to a certain point, and then--blooey! Something in us was\ndifferent, unrelated; I don't doubt that Tweel thought me just as screwy\nas I thought him. Our minds simply looked at the world from different\nviewpoints, and perhaps his viewpoint is as true as ours. But--we\ncouldn't get together, that's all. Yet, in spite of all difficulties, I\n_liked_ Tweel, and I have a queer certainty that he liked me.\"\n\n\"Nuts!\" repeated the captain. \"Just daffy!\"\n\n\"Yeah? Wait and see. A couple of times I've thought that perhaps we--\"\nHe paused, and then resumed his narrative. \"Anyway, I finally gave it\nup, and got into my thermo-skin to sleep. The fire hadn't kept me any\ntoo warm, but that damned sleeping bag did. Got stuffy five minutes\nafter I closed myself in. I opened it a little and bingo! Some\neighty-below-zero air hit my nose, and that's when I got this pleasant\nlittle frostbite to add to the bump I acquired during the crash of my\nrocket.\n\n\"I don't know what Tweel made of my sleeping. He sat around, but when I\nwoke up, he was gone. I'd just crawled out of my bag, though, when I\nheard some twittering, and there he came, sailing down from that\nthree-story Thyle cliff to alight on his beak beside me. I pointed to\nmyself and toward the north, and he pointed at himself and toward the\nsouth, but when I loaded up and started away, he came along.\n\n\"Man, how he traveled! A hundred and fifty feet at a jump, sailing\nthrough the air stretched out like a spear, and landing on his beak. He\nseemed surprised at my plodding, but after a few moments he fell in\nbeside me, only every few minutes he'd go into one of his leaps, and\nstick his nose into the sand a block ahead of me. Then he'd come\nshooting back at me; it made me nervous at first to see that beak of his\ncoming at me like a spear, but he always ended in the sand at my side.\n\n\"So the two of us plugged along across the Mare Chronium. Same sort of\nplace as this--same crazy plants and same little green biopods growing\nin the sand, or crawling out of your way. We talked--not that we\nunderstood each other, you know, but just for company. I sang songs, and\nI suspect Tweel did too; at least, some of his trillings and twitterings\nhad a subtle sort of rhythm.\n\n\"Then, for variety, Tweel would display his smattering of English words.\nHe'd point to an outcropping and say 'rock,' and point to a pebble and\nsay it again; or he'd touch my arm and say 'Tick,' and then repeat it.\nHe seemed terrifically amused that the same word meant the same thing\ntwice in succession, or that the same word could apply to two different\nobjects. It set me wondering if perhaps his language wasn't like the\nprimitive speech of some earth people--you know, Captain, like the\nNegritoes, for instance, who haven't any generic words. No word for food\nor water or man--words for good food and bad food, or rain water and sea\nwater, or strong man and weak man--but no names for general classes.\nThey're too primitive to understand that rain water and sea water are\njust different aspects of the same thing. But that wasn't the case with\nTweel; it was just that we were somehow mysteriously different--our\nminds were alien to each other. And yet--we _liked_ each other!\"\n\n\"Looney, that's all,\" remarked Harrison. \"That's why you two were so\nfond of each other.\"\n\n\"Well, I like _you_!\" countered Jarvis wickedly. \"Anyway,\" he resumed,\n\"don't get the idea that there was anything screwy about Tweel. In fact,\nI'm not so sure but that he couldn't teach our highly praised human\nintelligence a trick or two. Oh, he wasn't an intellectual superman, I\nguess; but don't overlook the point that he managed to understand a\nlittle of my mental workings, and I never even got a glimmering of his.\"\n\n\"Because he didn't have any!\" suggested the captain, while Putz and\nLeroy blinked attentively.\n\n\"You can judge of that when I'm through,\" said Jarvis. \"Well, we plugged\nalong across the Mare Chronium all that day, and all the next. Mare\nChronium--Sea of Time! Say, I was willing to agree with Schiaparelli's\nname by the end of that march! Just that grey, endless plain of weird\nplants, and never a sign of any other life. It was so monotonous that I\nwas even glad to see the desert of Xanthus toward the evening of the\nsecond day.\n\n\"I was fair worn out, but Tweel seemed as fresh as ever, for all I never\nsaw him drink or eat. I think he could have crossed the Mare Chronium in\na couple of hours with those block-long nose dives of his, but he stuck\nalong with me. I offered him some water once or twice; he took the cup\nfrom me and sucked the liquid into his beak, and then carefully squirted\nit all back into the cup and gravely returned it.\n\n\"Just as we sighted Xanthus, or the cliffs that bounded it, one of those\nnasty sand clouds blew along, not as bad as the one we had here, but\nmean to travel against. I pulled the transparent flap of my thermo-skin\nbag across my face and managed pretty well, and I noticed that Tweel\nused some feathery appendages growing like a mustache at the base of his\nbeak to cover his nostrils, and some similar fuzz to shield his eyes.\"\n\n\"He is a desert creature!\" ejaculated the little biologist, Leroy.\n\n\"Huh? Why?\"\n\n\"He drink no water--he is adapt' for sand storm--\"\n\n\"Proves nothing! There's not enough water to waste any where on this\ndesiccated pill called Mars. We'd call all of it desert on earth, you\nknow.\" He paused. \"Anyway, after the sand storm blew over, a little wind\nkept blowing in our faces, not strong enough to stir the sand. But\nsuddenly things came drifting along from the Xanthus cliffs--small,\ntransparent spheres, for all the world like glass tennis balls! But\nlight--they were almost light enough to float even in this thin\nair--empty, too; at least, I cracked open a couple and nothing came out\nbut a bad smell. I asked Tweel about them, but all he said was 'No, no,\nno,' which I took to mean that he knew nothing about them. So they went\nbouncing by like tumbleweeds, or like soap bubbles, and we plugged on\ntoward Xanthus. Tweel pointed at one of the crystal balls once and said\n'rock,' but I was too tired to argue with him. Later I discovered what\nhe meant.\n\n\"We came to the bottom of the Xanthus cliffs finally, when there wasn't\nmuch daylight left. I decided to sleep on the plateau if possible;\nanything dangerous, I reasoned, would be more likely to prowl through\nthe vegetation of the Mare Chronium than the sand of Xanthus. Not that\nI'd seen a single sign of menace, except the rope-armed black thing that\nhad trapped Tweel, and apparently that didn't prowl at all, but lured\nits victims within reach. It couldn't lure me while I slept, especially\nas Tweel didn't seem to sleep at all, but simply sat patiently around\nall night. I wondered how the creature had managed to trap Tweel, but\nthere wasn't any way of asking him. I found that out too, later; it's\ndevilish!\n\n\"However, we were ambling around the base of the Xanthus barrier looking\nfor an easy spot to climb. At least, I was. Tweel could have leaped it\neasily, for the cliffs were lower than Thyle--perhaps sixty feet. I\nfound a place and started up, swearing at the water tank strapped to my\nback--it didn't bother me except when climbing--and suddenly I heard a\nsound that I thought I recognized!\n\n\"You know how deceptive sounds are in this thin air. A shot sounds like\nthe pop of a cork. But this sound was the drone of a rocket, and sure\nenough, there went our second auxiliary about ten miles to westward,\nbetween me and the sunset!\"\n\n\"Vas me!\" said Putz. \"I hunt for you.\"\n\n\"Yeah; I knew that, but what good did it do me? I hung on to the cliff\nand yelled and waved with one hand. Tweel saw it too, and set up a\ntrilling and twittering, leaping to the top of the barrier and then high\ninto the air. And while I watched, the machine droned on into the\nshadows to the south.\n\n\"I scrambled to the top of the cliff. Tweel was still pointing and\ntrilling excitedly, shooting up toward the sky and coming down head-on\nto stick upside down on his beak in the sand. I pointed toward the south\nand at myself, and he said, 'Yes--Yes--Yes'; but somehow I gathered that\nhe thought the flying thing was a relative of mine, probably a parent.\nPerhaps I did his intellect an injustice; I think now that I did.\n\n\"I was bitterly disappointed by the failure to attract attention. I\npulled out my thermo-skin bag and crawled into it, as the night chill\nwas already apparent. Tweel stuck his beak into the sand and drew up his\nlegs and arms and looked for all the world like one of those leafless\nshrubs out there. I think he stayed that way all night.\"\n\n\"Protective mimicry!\" ejaculated Leroy. \"See? He is desert creature!\"\n\n\"In the morning,\" resumed Jarvis, \"we started off again. We hadn't gone\na hundred yards into Xanthus when I saw something queer! This is one\nthing Putz didn't photograph, I'll wager!\n\n\"There was a line of little pyramids--tiny ones, not more than six\ninches high, stretching across Xanthus as far as I could see! Little\nbuildings made of pygmy bricks, they were, hollow inside and truncated,\nor at least broken at the top and empty. I pointed at them and said\n'What?' to Tweel, but he gave some negative twitters to indicate, I\nsuppose, that he didn't know. So off we went, following the row of\npyramids because they ran north, and I was going north.\n\n\"Man, we trailed that line for hours! After a while, I noticed another\nqueer thing: they were getting larger. Same number of bricks in each\none, but the bricks were larger.\n\n\"By noon they were shoulder high. I looked into a couple--all just the\nsame, broken at the top and empty. I examined a brick or two as well;\nthey were silica, and old as creation itself!\"\n\n\"How you know?\" asked Leroy.\n\n\"They were weathered--edges rounded. Silica doesn't weather easily even\non earth, and in this climate--!\"\n\n\"How old you think?\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand--a hundred thousand years. How can I tell? The little\nones we saw in the morning were older--perhaps ten times as old.\nCrumbling. How old would that make _them_? Half a million years? Who\nknows?\" Jarvis paused a moment. \"Well,\" he resumed, \"we followed the\nline. Tweel pointed at them and said 'rock' once or twice, but he'd done\nthat many times before. Besides, he was more or less right about these.\n\n\"I tried questioning him. I pointed at a pyramid and asked 'People?' and\nindicated the two of us. He set up a negative sort of clucking and said,\n'No, no, no. No one-one-two. No two-two-four,' meanwhile rubbing his\nstomach. I just stared at him and he went through the business again.\n'No one-one-two. No two-two-four.' I just gaped at him.\"\n\n\"That proves it!\" exclaimed Harrison. \"Nuts!\"\n\n\"You think so?\" queried Jarvis sardonically. \"Well, I figured it out\ndifferent! 'No one-one-two!' You don't get it, of course, do you?\"\n\n\"Nope--nor do you!\"\n\n\"I think I do! Tweel was using the few English words he knew to put over\na very complex idea. What, let me ask, does mathematics make you think\nof?\"\n\n\"Why--of astronomy. Or--or logic!\"\n\n\"That's it! 'No one-one-two!' Tweel was telling me that the builders of\nthe pyramids weren't people--or that they weren't intelligent, that they\nweren't reasoning creatures! Get it?\"\n\n\"Huh! I'll be damned!\"\n\n\"You probably will.\"\n\n\"Why,\" put in Leroy, \"he rub his belly?\"\n\n\"Why? Because, my dear biologist, that's where his brains are! Not in\nhis tiny head--in his middle!\"\n\n\"_C'est_ impossible!\"\n\n\"Not on Mars, it isn't! This flora and fauna aren't earthly; your\nbiopods prove that!\" Jarvis grinned and took up his narrative. \"Anyway,\nwe plugged along across Xanthus and in about the middle of the\nafternoon, something else queer happened. The pyramids ended.\"\n\n\"Ended!\"\n\n\"Yeah; the queer part was that the last one--and now they were\nten-footers--was capped! See? Whatever built it was still inside; we'd\ntrailed 'em from their half-million-year-old origin to the present.\n\n\"Tweel and I noticed it about the same time. I yanked out my automatic\n(I had a clip of Boland explosive bullets in it) and Tweel, quick as a\nsleight-of-hand trick, snapped a queer little glass revolver out of his\nbag. It was much like our weapons, except that the grip was larger to\naccommodate his four-taloned hand. And we held our weapons ready while\nwe sneaked up along the lines of empty pyramids.\n\n\"Tweel saw the movement first. The top tiers of bricks were heaving,\nshaking, and suddenly slid down the sides with a thin crash. And\nthen--something--something was coming out!\n\n\"A long, silvery-grey arm appeared, dragging after it an armored body.\nArmored, I mean, with scales, silver-grey and dull-shining. The arm\nheaved the body out of the hole; the beast crashed to the sand.\n\n\"It was a nondescript creature--body like a big grey cask, arm and a\nsort of mouth-hole at one end; stiff, pointed tail at the other--and\nthat's all. No other limbs, no eyes, ears, nose--nothing! The thing\ndragged itself a few yards, inserted its pointed tail in the sand,\npushed itself upright, and just sat.\n\n\"Tweel and I watched it for ten minutes before it moved. Then, with a\ncreaking and rustling like--oh, like crumpling stiff paper--its arm\nmoved to the mouth-hole and out came a brick! The arm placed the brick\ncarefully on the ground, and the thing was still again.\n\n\"Another ten minutes--another brick. Just one of Nature's bricklayers.\nI was about to slip away and move on when Tweel pointed at the thing and\nsaid 'rock'! I went 'huh?' and he said it again. Then, to the\naccompaniment of some of his trilling, he said, 'No--no--,' and gave two\nor three whistling breaths.\n\n\"Well, I got his meaning, for a wonder! I said, 'No breath?' and\ndemonstrated the word. Tweel was ecstatic; he said, 'Yes, yes, yes! No,\nno, no breet!' Then he gave a leap and sailed out to land on his nose\nabout one pace from the monster!\n\n\"I was startled, you can imagine! The arm was going up for a brick, and\nI expected to see Tweel caught and mangled, but--nothing happened! Tweel\npounded on the creature, and the arm took the brick and placed it neatly\nbeside the first. Tweel rapped on its body again, and said 'rock,' and I\ngot up nerve enough to take a look myself.\n\n\"Tweel was right again. The creature was rock, and it didn't breathe!\"\n\n\"How you know?\" snapped Leroy, his black eyes blazing interest.\n\n\"Because I'm a chemist. The beast was made of silica! There must have\nbeen pure silicon in the sand, and it lived on that. Get it? We, and\nTweel, and those plants out there, and even the biopods are _carbon_\nlife; this thing lived by a different set of chemical reactions. It was\nsilicon life!\"\n\n\"_La vie silicieuse!_\" shouted Leroy. \"I have suspect, and now it is\nproof! I must go see! _Il faut que je--_\"\n\n\"All right! All right!\" said Jarvis. \"You can go see. Anyhow, there the\nthing was, alive and yet not alive, moving every ten minutes, and then\nonly to remove a brick. Those bricks were its waste matter. See,\nFrenchy? We're carbon, and our waste is carbon dioxide, and this thing\nis silicon, and _its_ waste is silicon dioxide--silica. But silica is a\nsolid, hence the bricks. And it builds itself in, and when it is\ncovered, it moves over to a fresh place to start over. No wonder it\ncreaked! A living creature half a million years old!\"\n\n\"How you know how old?\" Leroy was frantic.\n\n\"We trailed its pyramids from the beginning, didn't we? If this weren't\nthe original pyramid builder, the series would have ended somewhere\nbefore we found him, wouldn't it?--ended and started over with the small\nones. That's simple enough, isn't it?\n\n\"But he reproduces, or tries to. Before the third brick came out, there\nwas a little rustle and out popped a whole stream of those little\ncrystal balls. They're his spores, or eggs, or seeds--call 'em what you\nwant. They went bouncing by across Xanthus just as they'd bounced by us\nback in the Mare Chronium. I've a hunch how they work, too--this is for\nyour information, Leroy. I think the crystal shell of silica is no more\nthan a protective covering, like an eggshell, and that the active\nprinciple is the smell inside. It's some sort of gas that attacks\nsilicon, and if the shell is broken near a supply of that element, some\nreaction starts that ultimately develops into a beast like that one.\"\n\n\"You should try!\" exclaimed the little Frenchman. \"We must break one to\nsee!\"\n\n\"Yeah? Well, I did. I smashed a couple against the sand. Would you like\nto come back in about ten thousand years to see if I planted some\npyramid monsters? You'd most likely be able to tell by that time!\"\nJarvis paused and drew a deep breath. \"Lord! That queer creature! Do you\npicture it? Blind, deaf, nerveless, brainless--just a mechanism, and\nyet--immortal! Bound to go on making bricks, building pyramids, as long\nas silicon and oxygen exist, and even afterwards it'll just stop. It\nwon't be dead. If the accidents of a million years bring it its food\nagain, there it'll be, ready to run again, while brains and\ncivilizations are part of the past. A queer beast--yet I met a stranger\none!\"\n\n\"If you did, it must have been in your dreams!\" growled Harrison.\n\n\"You're right!\" said Jarvis soberly. \"In a way, you're right. The\ndream-beast! That's the best name for it--and it's the most fiendish,\nterrifying creation one could imagine! More dangerous than a lion, more\ninsidious than a snake!\"\n\n\"Tell me!\" begged Leroy. \"I must go see!\"\n\n\"Not _this_ devil!\" He paused again. \"Well,\" he resumed, \"Tweel and I\nleft the pyramid creature and plowed along through Xanthus. I was tired\nand a little disheartened by Putz's failure to pick me up, and Tweel's\ntrilling got on my nerves, as did his flying nosedives. So I just strode\nalong without a word, hour after hour across that monotonous desert.\n\n\"Toward mid-afternoon we came in sight of a low dark line on the\nhorizon. I knew what it was. It was a canal; I'd crossed it in the\nrocket and it meant that we were just one-third of the way across\nXanthus. Pleasant thought, wasn't it? And still, I was keeping up to\nschedule.\n\n\"We approached the canal slowly; I remembered that this one was bordered\nby a wide fringe of vegetation and that Mud-heap City was on it.\n\n\"I was tired, as I said. I kept thinking of a good hot meal, and then\nfrom that I jumped to reflections of how nice and home-like even Borneo\nwould seem after this crazy planet, and from that, to thoughts of little\nold New York, and then to thinking about a girl I know there--Fancy\nLong. Know her?\"\n\n\"Vision entertainer,\" said Harrison. \"I've tuned her in. Nice\nblonde--dances and sings on the _Yerba Mate_ hour.\"\n\n\"That's her,\" said Jarvis ungrammatically. \"I know her pretty well--just\nfriends, get me?--though she came down to see us off in the _Ares_.\nWell, I was thinking about her, feeling pretty lonesome, and all the\ntime we were approaching that line of rubbery plants.\n\n\"And then--I said, 'What 'n Hell!' and stared. And there she was--Fancy\nLong, standing plain as day under one of those crack-brained trees, and\nsmiling and waving just the way I remembered her when we left!\"\n\n\"Now you're nuts, too!\" observed the captain.\n\n\"Boy, I almost agreed with you! I stared and pinched myself and closed\nmy eyes and then stared again--and every time, there was Fancy Long\nsmiling and waving! Tweel saw something, too; he was trilling and\nclucking away, but I scarcely heard him. I was bounding toward her over\nthe sand, too amazed even to ask myself questions.\n\n\"I wasn't twenty feet from her when Tweel caught me with one of his\nflying leaps. He grabbed my arm, yelling, 'No--no--no!' in his squeaky\nvoice. I tried to shake him off--he was as light as if he were built of\nbamboo--but he dug his claws in and yelled. And finally some sort of\nsanity returned to me and I stopped less than ten feet from her. There\nshe stood, looking as solid as Putz's head!\"\n\n\"Vot?\" said the engineer.\n\n\"She smiled and waved, and waved and smiled, and I stood there dumb as\nLeroy, while Tweel squeaked and chattered. I _knew_ it couldn't be real,\nyet--there she was!\n\n\"Finally I said, 'Fancy! Fancy Long!' She just kept on smiling and\nwaving, but looking as real as if I hadn't left her thirty-seven million\nmiles away.\n\n\"Tweel had his glass pistol out, pointing it at her. I grabbed his arm,\nbut he tried to push me away. He pointed at her and said, 'No breet! No\nbreet!' and I understood that he meant that the Fancy Long thing wasn't\nalive. Man, my head was whirling!\n\n\"Still, it gave me the jitters to see him pointing his weapon at her. I\ndon't know why I stood there watching him take careful aim, but I did.\nThen he squeezed the handle of his weapon; there was a little puff of\nsteam, and Fancy Long was gone! And in her place was one of those\nwrithing, black, rope-armed horrors like the one I'd saved Tweel from!\n\n\"The dream-beast! I stood there dizzy, watching it die while Tweel\ntrilled and whistled. Finally he touched my arm, pointed at the twisting\nthing, and said, 'You one-one-two, he one-one-two.' After he'd repeated\nit eight or ten times, I got it. Do any of you?\"\n\n\"_Oui!_\" shrilled Leroy. \"_Moi--je le comprends!_ He mean you think of\nsomething, the beast he know, and you see it! _Un chien_--a hungry dog,\nhe would see the big bone with meat! Or smell it--not?\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Jarvis. \"The dream-beast uses its victim's longings and\ndesires to trap its prey. The bird at nesting season would see its mate,\nthe fox, prowling for its own prey, would see a helpless rabbit!\"\n\n\"How he do?\" queried Leroy.\n\n\"How do I know? How does a snake back on earth charm a bird into its\nvery jaws? And aren't there deep-sea fish that lure their victims into\ntheir mouths? Lord!\" Jarvis shuddered. \"Do you see how insidious the\nmonster is? We're warned now--but henceforth we can't trust even our\neyes. You might see me--I might see one of you--and back of it may be\nnothing but another of those black horrors!\"\n\n\"How'd your friend know?\" asked the captain abruptly.\n\n\"Tweel? I wonder! Perhaps he was thinking of something that couldn't\npossibly have interested me, and when I started to run, he realized\nthat I saw something different and was warned. Or perhaps the\ndream-beast can only project a single vision, and Tweel saw what I\nsaw--or nothing. I couldn't ask him. But it's just another proof that\nhis intelligence is equal to ours or greater.\"\n\n\"He's daffy, I tell you!\" said Harrison. \"What makes you think his\nintellect ranks with the human?\"\n\n\"Plenty of things! First, the pyramid-beast. He hadn't seen one before;\nhe said as much. Yet he recognized it as a dead-alive automaton of\nsilicon.\"\n\n\"He could have heard of it,\" objected Harrison. \"He lives around here,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Well how about the language? I couldn't pick up a single idea of his\nand he learned six or seven words of mine. And do you realize what\ncomplex ideas he put over with no more than those six or seven words?\nThe pyramid-monster--the dream-beast! In a single phrase he told me that\none was a harmless automaton and the other a deadly hypnotist. What\nabout that?\"\n\n\"Huh!\" said the captain.\n\n\"_Huh_ if you wish! Could you have done it knowing only six words of\nEnglish? Could you go even further, as Tweel did, and tell me that\nanother creature was of a sort of intelligence so different from ours\nthat understanding was impossible--even more impossible than that\nbetween Tweel and me?\"\n\n\"Eh? What was that?\"\n\n\"Later. The point I'm making is that Tweel and his race are worthy of\nour friendship. Somewhere on Mars--and you'll find I'm right--is a\ncivilization and culture equal to ours, and maybe more than equal. And\ncommunication is possible between them and us; Tweel proves that. It may\ntake years of patient trial, for their minds are alien, but less alien\nthan the next minds we encountered--if they _are_ minds.\"\n\n\"The next ones? What next ones?\"\n\n\"The people of the mud cities along the canals.\" Jarvis frowned, then\nresumed his narrative. \"I thought the dream-beast and the\nsilicon-monster were the strangest beings conceivable, but I was wrong.\nThese creatures are still more alien, less understandable than either\nand far less comprehensible than Tweel, with whom friendship is\npossible, and even, by patience and concentration, the exchange of\nideas.\n\n\"Well,\" he continued, \"we left the dream-beast dying, dragging itself\nback into its hole, and we moved toward the canal. There was a carpet of\nthat queer walking-grass scampering out of our way, and when we reached\nthe bank, there was a yellow trickle of water flowing. The mound city\nI'd noticed from the rocket was a mile or so to the right and I was\ncurious enough to want to take a look at it.\n\n\"It had seemed deserted from my previous glimpse of it, and if any\ncreatures were lurking in it--well, Tweel and I were both armed. And by\nthe way, that crystal weapon of Tweel's was an interesting device; I\ntook a look at it after the dream-beast episode. It fired a little glass\nsplinter, poisoned, I suppose, and I guess it held at least a hundred of\n'em to a load. The propellent was steam--just plain steam!\"\n\n\"Shteam!\" echoed Putz. \"From vot come, shteam?\"\n\n\"From water, of course! You could see the water through the transparent\nhandle and about a gill of another liquid, thick and yellowish. When\nTweel squeezed the handle--there was no trigger--a drop of water and a\ndrop of the yellow stuff squirted into the firing chamber, and the water\nvaporized--pop!--like that. It's not so difficult; I think we could\ndevelop the same principle. Concentrated sulphuric acid will heat water\nalmost to boiling, and so will quicklime, and there's potassium and\nsodium--\n\n\"Of course, his weapon hadn't the range of mine, but it wasn't so bad in\nthis thin air, and it _did_ hold as many shots as a cowboy's gun in a\nWestern movie. It was effective, too, at least against Martian life; I\ntried it out, aiming at one of the crazy plants, and darned if the plant\ndidn't wither up and fall apart! That's why I think the glass splinters\nwere poisoned.\n\n\"Anyway, we trudged along toward the mud-heap city and I began to wonder\nwhether the city builders dug the canals. I pointed to the city and then\nat the canal, and Tweel said 'No--no--no!' and gestured toward the\nsouth. I took it to mean that some other race had created the canal\nsystem, perhaps Tweel's people. I don't know; maybe there's still\nanother intelligent race on the planet, or a dozen others. Mars is a\nqueer little world.\n\n\"A hundred yards from the city we crossed a sort of road--just a\nhard-packed mud trail, and then, all of a sudden, along came one of the\nmound builders!\n\n\"Man, talk about fantastic beings! It looked rather like a barrel\ntrotting along on four legs with four other arms or tentacles. It had no\nhead, just body and members and a row of eyes completely around it. The\ntop end of the barrel-body was a diaphragm stretched as tight as a drum\nhead, and that was all. It was pushing a little coppery cart and tore\nright past us like the proverbial bat out of Hell. It didn't even notice\nus, although I thought the eyes on my side shifted a little as it\npassed.\n\n\"A moment later another came along, pushing another empty cart. Same\nthing--it just scooted past us. Well, I wasn't going to be ignored by a\nbunch of barrels playing train, so when the third one approached, I\nplanted myself in the way--ready to jump, of course, if the thing didn't\nstop.\n\n\"But it did. It stopped and set up a sort of drumming from the diaphragm\non top. And I held out both hands and said, 'We are friends!' And what\ndo you suppose the thing did?\"\n\n\"Said, 'Pleased to meet you,' I'll bet!\" suggested Harrison.\n\n\"I couldn't have been more surprised if it had! It drummed on its\ndiaphragm, and then suddenly boomed out, 'We are v-r-r-riends!' and gave\nits pushcart a vicious poke at me! I jumped aside, and away it went\nwhile I stared dumbly after it.\n\n\"A minute later another one came hurrying along. This one didn't pause,\nbut simply drummed out, 'We are v-r-r-riends!' and scurried by. How did\nit learn the phrase? Were all of the creatures in some sort of\ncommunication with each other? Were they all parts of some central\norganism? I don't know, though I think Tweel does.\n\n\"Anyway, the creatures went sailing past us, every one greeting\nus with the same statement. It got to be funny; I never thought to\nfind so many friends on this God-forsaken ball! Finally I made a\npuzzled gesture to Tweel; I guess he understood, for he said,\n'One-one-two--yes!--two-two-four--no!' Get it?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Harrison, \"It's a Martian nursery rhyme.\"\n\n\"Yeah! Well, I was getting used to Tweel's symbolism, and I figured it\nout this way. 'One-one-two--yes!' The creatures were intelligent.\n'Two-two-four--no!' Their intelligence was not of our order, but\nsomething different and beyond the logic of two and two is four. Maybe I\nmissed his meaning. Perhaps he meant that their minds were of low\ndegree, able to figure out the simple things--'One-one-two--yes!'--but\nnot more difficult things--'Two-two-four--no!' But I think from what we\nsaw later that he meant the other.\n\n\"After a few moments, the creatures came rushing back--first one, then\nanother. Their pushcarts were full of stones, sand, chunks of rubbery\nplants, and such rubbish as that. They droned out their friendly\ngreeting, which didn't really sound so friendly, and dashed on. The\nthird one I assumed to be my first acquaintance and I decided to have\nanother chat with him. I stepped into his path again and waited.\n\n\"Up he came, booming out his 'We are v-r-r-riends' and stopped. I looked\nat him; four or five of his eyes looked at me. He tried his password\nagain and gave a shove on his cart, but I stood firm. And then the--the\ndashed creature reached out one of his arms, and two finger-like nippers\ntweaked my nose!\"\n\n\"Haw!\" roared Harrison. \"Maybe the things have a sense of beauty!\"\n\n\"Laugh!\" grumbled Jarvis. \"I'd already had a nasty bump and a mean\nfrostbite on that nose. Anyway, I yelled 'Ouch!' and jumped aside and\nthe creature dashed away; but from then on, their greeting was 'We are\nv-r-r-riends! Ouch!' Queer beasts!\n\n\"Tweel and I followed the road squarely up to the nearest mound. The\ncreatures were coming and going, paying us not the slightest attention,\nfetching their loads of rubbish. The road simply dived into an opening,\nand slanted down like an old mine, and in and out darted the\nbarrel-people, greeting us with their eternal phrase.\n\n\"I looked in; there was a light somewhere below, and I was curious to\nsee it. It didn't look like a flame or torch, you understand, but more\nlike a civilized light, and I thought that I might get some clue as to\nthe creatures' development. So in I went and Tweel tagged along, not\nwithout a few trills and twitters, however.\n\n\"The light was curious; it sputtered and flared like an old arc light,\nbut came from a single black rod set in the wall of the corridor. It\nwas electric, beyond doubt. The creatures were fairly civilized,\napparently.\n\n\"Then I saw another light shining on something that glittered and I went\non to look at that, but it was only a heap of shiny sand. I turned\ntoward the entrance to leave, and the Devil take me if it wasn't gone!\n\n\"I suppose the corridor had curved, or I'd stepped into a side passage.\nAnyway, I walked back in that direction I thought we'd come, and all I\nsaw was more dimlit corridor. The place was a labyrinth! There was\nnothing but twisting passages running every way, lit by occasional\nlights, and now and then a creature running by, sometimes with a\npushcart, sometimes without.\n\n\"Well, I wasn't much worried at first. Tweel and I had only come a few\nsteps from the entrance. But every move we made after that seemed to get\nus in deeper. Finally I tried following one of the creatures with an\nempty cart, thinking that he'd be going out for his rubbish, but he ran\naround aimlessly, into one passage and out another. When he started\ndashing around a pillar like one of these Japanese waltzing mice, I gave\nup, dumped my water tank on the floor, and sat down.\n\n\"Tweel was as lost as I. I pointed up and he said 'No--no--no!' in a\nsort of helpless trill. And we couldn't get any help from the natives.\nThey paid no attention at all, except to assure us they were\nfriends--ouch!\n\n\"Lord! I don't know how many hours or days we wandered around there! I\nslept twice from sheer exhaustion; Tweel never seemed to need sleep. We\ntried following only the upward corridors, but they'd run uphill a ways\nand then curve downwards. The temperature in that damned ant hill was\nconstant; you couldn't tell night from day and after my first sleep I\ndidn't know whether I'd slept one hour or thirteen, so I couldn't tell\nfrom my watch whether it was midnight or noon.\n\n\"We saw plenty of strange things. There were machines running in some of\nthe corridors, but they didn't seem to be doing anything--just wheels\nturning. And several times I saw two barrel-beasts with a little one\ngrowing between them, joined to both.\"\n\n\"Parthenogenesis!\" exulted Leroy. \"Parthenogenesis by budding like _les\ntulipes_!\"\n\n\"If you say so, Frenchy,\" agreed Jarvis. \"The things never noticed us at\nall, except, as I say, to greet us with 'We are v-r-r-riends! Ouch!'\nThey seemed to have no home-life of any sort, but just scurried around\nwith their pushcarts, bringing in rubbish. And finally I discovered what\nthey did with it.\n\n\"We'd had a little luck with a corridor, one that slanted upwards for a\ngreat distance. I was feeling that we ought to be close to the surface\nwhen suddenly the passage debouched into a domed chamber, the only one\nwe'd seen. And man!--I felt like dancing when I saw what looked like\ndaylight through a crevice in the roof.\n\n\"There was a--a sort of machine in the chamber, just an enormous wheel\nthat turned slowly, and one of the creatures was in the act of dumping\nhis rubbish below it. The wheel ground it with a crunch--sand, stones,\nplants, all into powder that sifted away somewhere. While we watched,\nothers filed in, repeating the process, and that seemed to be all. No\nrhyme nor reason to the whole thing--but that's characteristic of this\ncrazy planet. And there was another fact that's almost too bizarre to\nbelieve.\n\n\"One of the creatures, having dumped his load, pushed his cart aside\nwith a crash and calmly shoved himself under the wheel! I watched him\nbeing crushed, too stupefied to make a sound, and a moment later,\nanother followed him! They were perfectly methodical about it, too; one\nof the cartless creatures took the abandoned pushcart.\n\n\"Tweel didn't seem surprised; I pointed out the next suicide to him, and\nhe just gave the most human-like shrug imaginable, as much as to say,\n'What can I do about it?' He must have known more or less about these\ncreatures.\n\n\"Then I saw something else. There was something beyond the wheel,\nsomething shining on a sort of low pedestal. I walked over; there was a\nlittle crystal about the size of an egg, fluorescing to beat Tophet. The\nlight from it stung my hands and face, almost like a static discharge,\nand then I noticed another funny thing. Remember that wart I had on my\nleft thumb? Look!\" Jarvis extended his hand. \"It dried up and fell\noff--just like that! And my abused nose--say, the pain went out of it\nlike magic! The thing had the property of hard x-rays or gamma\nradiations, only more so; it destroyed diseased tissue and left healthy\ntissue unharmed!\n\n\"I was thinking what a present _that'd_ be to take back to Mother Earth\nwhen a lot of racket interrupted. We dashed back to the other side of\nthe wheel in time to see one of the pushcarts ground up. Some suicide\nhad been careless, it seems.\n\n\"Then suddenly the creatures were booming and drumming all around us and\ntheir noise was decidedly menacing. A crowd of them advanced toward us;\nwe backed out of what I thought was the passage we'd entered by, and\nthey came rumbling after us, some pushing carts and some not. Crazy\nbrutes! There was a whole chorus of 'We are v-r-r-riends! Ouch!' I\ndidn't like the 'ouch'; it was rather suggestive.\n\n\"Tweel had his glass gun out and I dumped my water tank for greater\nfreedom and got mine. We backed up the corridor with the barrel-beasts\nfollowing--about twenty of them. Queer thing--the ones coming in with\nloaded carts moved past us inches away without a sign.\n\n\"Tweel must have noticed that. Suddenly, he snatched out that glowing\ncoal cigar-lighter of his and touched a cart-load of plant limbs. Puff!\nThe whole load was burning--and the crazy beast pushing it went right\nalong without a change of pace! It created some disturbance among our\n'V-r-r-riends,' however--and then I noticed the smoke eddying and\nswirling past us, and sure enough, there was the entrance!\n\n\"I grabbed Tweel and out we dashed and after us our twenty pursuers. The\ndaylight felt like Heaven, though I saw at first glance that the sun was\nall but set, and that was bad, since I couldn't live outside my\nthermo-skin bag in a Martian night--at least, without a fire.\n\n\"And things got worse in a hurry. They cornered us in an angle between\ntwo mounds, and there we stood. I hadn't fired nor had Tweel; there\nwasn't any use in irritating the brutes. They stopped a little distance\naway and began their booming about friendship and ouches.\n\n\"Then things got still worse! A barrel-brute came out with a pushcart\nand they all grabbed into it and came out with handfuls of foot-long\ncopper darts--sharp-looking ones--and all of a sudden one sailed past my\near--zing! And it was shoot or die then.\n\n\"We were doing pretty well for a while. We picked off the ones next to\nthe pushcart and managed to keep the darts at a minimum, but suddenly\nthere was a thunderous booming of 'v-r-r-riends' and 'ouches,' and a\nwhole army of 'em came out of their hole.\n\n\"Man! We were through and I knew it! Then I realized that Tweel wasn't.\nHe could have leaped the mound behind us as easily as not. He was\nstaying for me!\n\n\"Say, I could have cried if there'd been time! I'd liked Tweel from the\nfirst, but whether I'd have had gratitude to do what he was\ndoing--suppose I _had_ saved him from the first dream-beast--he'd done\nas much for me, hadn't he? I grabbed his arm, and said 'Tweel,' and\npointed up, and he understood. He said, 'No--no--no, Tick!' and popped\naway with his glass pistol.\n\n\"What could I do? I'd be a goner anyway when the sun set, but I couldn't\nexplain that to him. I said, 'Thanks, Tweel. You're a man!' and felt\nthat I wasn't paying him any compliment at all. A man! There are mighty\nfew men who'd do that.\n\n\"So I went 'bang' with my gun and Tweel went 'puff' with his, and the\nbarrels were throwing darts and getting ready to rush us, and booming\nabout being friends. I had given up hope. Then suddenly an angel dropped\nright down from Heaven in the shape of Putz, with his under-jets\nblasting the barrels into very small pieces!\n\n\"Wow! I let out a yell and dashed for the rocket; Putz opened the door\nand in I went, laughing and crying and shouting! It was a moment or so\nbefore I remembered Tweel; I looked around in time to see him rising in\none of his nosedives over the mound and away.\n\n\"I had a devil of a job arguing Putz into following! By the time we got\nthe rocket aloft, darkness was down; you know how it comes here--like\nturning off a light. We sailed out over the desert and put down once or\ntwice. I yelled 'Tweel!' and yelled it a hundred times, I guess. We\ncouldn't find him; he could travel like the wind and all I got--or else\nI imagined it--was a faint trilling and twittering drifting out of the\nsouth. He'd gone, and damn it! I wish--I wish he hadn't!\"\n\nThe four men of the _Ares_ were silent--even the sardonic Harrison. At\nlast little Leroy broke the stillness.\n\n\"I should like to see,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Harrison. \"And the wart-cure. Too bad you missed that; it\nmight be the cancer cure they've been hunting for a century and a half.\"\n\n\"Oh, that!\" muttered Jarvis gloomily. \"That's what started the fight!\"\nHe drew a glistening object from his pocket.\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Martian Odyssey, by Stanley Grauman Weinbaum"}

Frye tries to rape her, but she forces him to leave at gunpoint and calls the police. Detective Tony Clemenza tells her that Frye has an airtight alibi as the police called his home and he answered, proving that he couldn't have been anywhere near Los Angeles that night.\nThe next day Frye returns and attacks Hilary again, this time receiving several stab wounds before escaping. She calls the police and once again meets with Clemenza, who tells her that Frye's body has been found and takes her to the morgue to identify it. Afterward, Clemenza asks Hilary out, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\nHilary is once again attacked by a man who appears to be Frye. \"Frye\" escapes just before Clemenza arrives and Hilary tells him what happened. After some investigations, Frye's psychologist lets them listen to a tape recording of one of Frye's sessions. Frye talks about identical twins being born with cauls on their faces, and says he read somewhere that this was a mark of a demon.\nFrye has been killing women he believes are possessed by the spirit of his dead mother, who abused him and said she would come back from the dead. He believes that Hilary is his mother's latest \"host\".\nHilary and Tony meet a retired madam who tells them that Leo, Frye's grandfather, brought his daughter, Katherine, there to be cared for after he got her pregnant. Shortly after Leo's death, Katherine gave birth to identical twin boys. The twins were born with cauls on their faces, leading the mentally unstable Katherine to believe they were demons. She raised her sons as if they were one person. They were both called Bruno, and both were rewarded or punished for anything either one of them did.\nFinally, Hilary and Clemenza return to Frye's home, where he once again attacks them, before being killed during a struggle with Clemenza.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK WHISPERS ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Al Haines.\n\n\n\n\nCover Page 1\n\nPAUL CAMERON BROWN\nWhispers\n\nCopyright Â© 1977 by Paul Cameron Brown\nAll rights reserved\n\n***************************************************************\nCover Page 2\n\nPaul Cameron Brown was born in London, England in 1948.\n\nMoving to Canada, he grew up in Kingston before\nattending high school in the southern community of Chatham.\nHe spent five years at University of Western\nOntario in London with summers interspersed between\nwork and travel.

tone,\na hoarse calling\ngrew louder as I paced\ntrying to see rain.\n\nI followed the gravity of the treasure hunt\nwhere each bounce meant a slap\nacross a table top of tension,\nwhere the window basted winter black rain\nand silence paid another call.\n\nI am as much as this water flower, rain.\nI am as impressionable as the city that stops for rain.\nAnd I lack the same substance that dooms water to be\na soft pillow feather; excepting this,\nI may still shatter this thing, March routine existence\nby dabbling in destruction.\n10\n***************************************************************\nISLES AND RIVULETS\n\nOn your brow, the steppes of Asia\nare fetched by deep set eyes\nA colouring distict with

action\nIts focus, brittle reality,\nDistant life unaware around even itself.\n\nWaiting, the syringe filled ecstasy is\nBarest of autistic treasure\nSatiate, 'til spilled and\nMolten over toughened

sightless villagers;\ntheir torn members\ntoys of plastic\nwedged obscene within the dash of withered bells.\n16\n***************************************************************\nTHE WORLD OF DYING LOVE\n\nThe long finger of blackness is holding its head for us.\nDingy bue is its shade,\ncomatose in movement, hazarding a slow swiftness,\nit inches toward us.\n\nRelief comes fitfully.\nThe dragon alone, an upstart\ncrowned with drunken spending,\nhas horse colours as ribbons with his eyes.\nIt cradles a breast of trembling bone.\n\nMisercorde, Misercorde.\nI dreamt I saw skeletal slackness\ndangling;\nthe poverty of touch is a casket\nwith love in rumbling sockets.\nCraziness is the passion of the engulfed,\ndribbling pleasantly.\n\nPresentations extended beyond and into themselves.\nSlackness schemes with invalid awareness\nin a brothel of hope.\n17\n***************************************************************\nPart II\nWHISPERS\n\nDARKENING GREEN\n\nMy mind,

grain.\n19\n***************************************************************\nWHISPERS\n\nSuppose and this is just supposing,\nthough it is a supposition of the highest order,\nI were to die tomorrow\n\nA roar denoting silence?\nAt work, if tradition is the dictate,\nsomething eulogistic would find itself being said.\n\nI am more calm.\nI perceive their layers more shrilly.\nPast the

rust.\n21\n***************************************************************\nFOREST SPITTLE\n\nThe preciseness of that little moment,\nbowler eyes in hot, top rays\neffervescent through\nspongy forest gloom,\nthe wet of the happy\nunreconciled with the dry outside.\n22\n***************************************************************\nSEAGULLS\nI see many thoughts from a window.\nSeagulls in the fashion of summer\nand leaves as they quit the year.\nSense impressions, if they are this,\nare only images\nof what we refuse to follow.\n23\n***************************************************************\nLA DOUCE MER\n\nToo greedy hormonal levels,\nsavouring drives and swooned walrus tusks\nbehind the deep belly\nof tireless sea,\npropel ocean crates\nlooser for their water\nthan blood\nto devour cavernous shores,\nswilling miniature inland\nsweet water seas that\nfather Champlain called\ndouce mer lakes;\ndubbing there a blow for courage.\n24\n***************************************************************\nGOURDS\nA cemetery overgrown\nsuch that each tombstone is a pauper fungus\ncrowded, dark with leaves,\nor hollow gourds hideous,\nin a forest sleep.\n25\n***************************************************************\nRESIGNATION\n\nPetals that fall into a woodland pool\nare servers at a banquet.\nEach one dresses for the occasion\nlike an employee with regrets,\nthat leaves the house in a somber mood\nthe morning after his resignation.\n26\n***************************************************************\nTHE BREATH OF CANDLES\n\nThe breath of candles,\nhot and murky,\non the still air.\n\nGiant factories wave wands\nin luxury;\ncontaminate roving commuter bands\nbrown, from dirt knitted through white bread hair.\n27\n***************************************************************\nGREEN EYE SHIELDS\n\nI have stars drying in my eyes.\nHeavy seas, in wind.\nThey have sealed me from the heavy\ndragging sockets, otherwise my green eye shields.\n\nI have scars all over my eyes,\nto bear the horrible imaginings\nthat try to come through.\n\nThe horror of being alive.\nThe crusty scenes that pry into trees\nglide down, touch me,\na glitter of awful gold steals me,\nin its triumph of glow.\n28\n***************************************************************\nINVESTITURE\n\nOur nights have cruel eyes\nAnd have cast us about too thinly,\nFallen upon us,\nDivested the attention of the wind.\n\nNight comes to develop us,\nWill polish our minds with\nA precision lasting 'til daybreak.\nIts damp coolness peaks with wretched effect.\n\nAutumnal decay\nWhereby the slow process of vegetation\nDispleases the nostril,\nIs but a preamble to greater violence\nLeading tepid legislation in an orchestra\nToward greater effect.\n\nThe thin harmony of our lives\nPositions no alarms whereby\nWe might use them.\n\nThe fabric mixture of existence, nothing but investiture,\nProps to heighten necessary lies,\nStrains at extinction,\nThe volcanic instrument life itself.\n\nGoals are these same vehicles\nTo operate weak desires.\nFrustration defeats a goal\nThat will not fit.\n29\n***************************************************************\nTHE SPOKEN WORD\nI touch your\nface - where strands of whispery hair\ndangle your thoughtful gaze through mine.\n\nClutching,\nall the words not said\nlie pale and broken\nbeneath forgery lies.\n\n\nEyes, our facial minnows, the mirror\nimages, flash too brightly\nout of the shallows,\nout of their stony commitments\ntowards believing\nwe cannot agree.\n30\n***************************************************************\nPart III\nTESTIMONY\n\nSMEARS\n\nA snowy morning\nunfolding\nI smear my eyes\nthe crimson details\nfrom my life.\n32\n***************************************************************\nTESTIMONY\n\nWhen snow falls, there lives\nthe shrill cries that\nleaves are not alone.\n\nEach flake, a mute testimony\nnot a leaf falls before\nsurgery prunes the individual tree.\n\nCold November after\nbrown and white conspire,\nthe forest leaves a bleeding crust,\nscar tissue from natural wars.\n33\n***************************************************************\nFORTRESS SNOW\n\nThe embankment lies as heavy\nedges on our lives.\nThe shadows of the rock,\npiled drifts huge monotony's ledge,\naccumulations by the side of the tree\nwear thin visages;\nthe breath of summer eclipsed.\n\nSnow reigns supreme;\nteeters about the rim\nof the city's existence.\nPettiness of man's realm - pretty\nfoliage of the transient,\nwrappings upon our lives\nbrittle near the storm.\n\nThe reply of the eternal,\nfire on stone\nblazons reality\nthe peaked remains\nof snow streaked sun.\n\nImmensity governs us;\nclarity of the temporal\nfire set by the staccato\nof man's rhythm.\n34\n***************************************************************\nCIENFUEGOS\n\nThe white pin wheel of heat turns up the grasses' edge.\nSome dried plant stalks shrivel,\nthen melt openly into layers of fire.\nIt is end - time for the community's Christmas trees.\n\nSomething akin to burnt offerings,\nreluctant souls or\nhedging captives kept alive\nghoulishly for some cannibal's feast;\nthis festival of crackling.\n\n\nThey have served their purpose, now.\nBound, no faggots need be applied.\nContumely, the quiet desperation darkens\nthe child's face.\n\nThe headlights rain down on Christmas' debris.\nA hundred little fires as cigarette warnings\ndaub the night air.\nThe forest of smoke, canyon of the torch,\nwhere black marauders poke the nostril.\n35\n***************************************************************\nDEVASTATION\n\nLittle red berries are\nthe crop of this stump tree.\nThey are the prize stubble\nwhere little growth is come.\n\nA transplant of hair after\na serious illness\nor after fire ravages\nthe body's wilderness\nis that first sip of broth taken.\n\nLittle by little, they bring cautious\nhope that more will\nstumble into other pocket crevices,\nthe bits of life amidst the spores of stillness.\n36\n***************************************************************\nBEE AN APPLE\nThe taste of an apple,\nthe cringing of a bee\nas sun stops turning\na ladle over their skins;\nthe fire gold stains\non apple's skin,\nthe honey yellow, black bits\na hornet wrinkles in.\n37\n***************************************************************\nEMPTINESS\n\nThe threadbare uniforms\nwe let stare at others\nwe would refuse ourselves.\n\nThe bare walls,

The shooter leaves a perfect trail behind for the police to quickly track him down. Evidence from the scene, of a shell case and a quarter bearing the same fingerprints, points clearly to James Barr, a former Army infantry sniper. He is arrested, but will only say two things to the police: \"They got the wrong guy,\" and \"Get Jack Reacher for me.\" Reacher, a former Army military police officer and now a drifter, is 1500 miles away, but sees the news on CNN and gets on a bus to Indiana. Reacher has no job, no home, no car, and a shrinking savings account from his past military pay. Although Reacher has a nomadic existence, what he does have is sharp moral clarity in a modern climate of moral ambiguity.\nInstead of clearing Barr, Reacher wants to assist the prosecution in convicting him. Reacher is the last person Barr would want to see for good reason. When Reacher was an investigating military policeman years past, Barr had gone on a killing spree similar to the Indiana shootout, murdering four men during the Gulf War in Kuwait City. Convoluted military politics and a technicality let Barr walk free. Reacher swore he would track the sniper down if he ever tried it again. Reacher believes Barr is guilty, but Barr's sister Rosemary is convinced of her brother's innocence and entreats lawyer Helen Rodin to defend her brother. Helen's father is the district attorney who will prosecute the case. When Reacher arrives in Indiana, Barr has been beaten so badly while in prison that he cannot remember anything about the day of the murders, leaving Reacher to form his own conclusions with the available evidence. The local NBC news reporter, Ann Yanni, is also looking for more information, and Reacher is more than willing to include her in his investigation, in exchange for the use of her car and a guaranteed public expose on the Barr case. Reacher knows that 35 yards, the parking garage shooting distance to the victims, is point-blank range for a trained military sniper like Barr. Reacher also knows the shooter missed one shot on purpose, giving Reacher one shot at the truth.\nReacher drives to Kentucky to the shooting range where the sniper practiced and learns some interesting facts from Gunny Samuel Cash, the former US Marine who owns the shooting range, which make him doubt the solidity of the presumably airtight case against Barr. Cash is unwilling to reveal information or his records to Reacher, but grudgingly agrees to talk if Reacher is able to hit a paper target dead center at 300 yards with one shot. After he succeeds, Reacher is shown 32 sheets of target paper from three years' worth of Barr's practice shootings at his range, every single sheet with dead-on maximum scores.\nAfter the visit to the shooting range, Reacher adds Cash's information to the case evidence. Helen and Rosemary sift through the clues in a riveting analysis and finally get Reacher to conclude that Barr is innocent, which means someone set up Barr as the sniper. Someone is also trying to get Reacher off the case, which formerly seemed a slam-dunk, but is now falling apart. Reacher is teamed with Helen, the young defense lawyer working against her D.A. father with a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. Reacher gets closer to the unseen enemy pulling the strings, leading him to the real perpetrators, a Russian gang masquerading as legitimate businessmen. The gang's 80-year-old capo spent much of his life in one of the infamous Soviet gulags and is known only as the Zec (prisoner). Reacher outwits the mob guards in the Russian gang's fortress, efficiently and brutally dispatching five hoods before confronting the boss and forcing him to come clean on the conspiracy from beginning to end.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK ONE-SHOT ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONE-SHOT\n\n _You can do a great deal if\n you have enough data, and\n enough time to compute on it,\n by logical methods. But given\n the situation that neither data\n nor time is adequate, and an\n answer must be produced ...\n what do you do?_\n\nBY JAMES BLISH\n\nIllustrated by van Dongen\n\n\nOn the day that the Polish freighter _Ludmilla_ laid an egg in New York\nharbor, Abner Longmans (\"One-Shot\") Braun was in the city going about\nhis normal business, which was making another million dollars. As we\nfound out later, almost nothing else was normal about that particular\nweek end for Braun. For one thing, he had brought his family with him--a\ncomplete departure from routine--reflecting the unprecedentedly\nlegitimate nature of the deals he was trying to make. From every point\nof view it was a bad week end for the CIA to mix into his affairs, but\nnobody had explained that to the master of the _Ludmilla_.\n\nI had better add here that we knew nothing about this until afterward;\nfrom the point of view of the storyteller, an organization like Civilian\nIntelligence Associates gets to all its facts backwards, entering the\ntale at the pay-off, working back to the hook, and winding up with a\nsheaf of background facts to feed into the computer for Next Time. It's\nrough on the various people who've tried to fictionalize what we\ndo--particularly for the lazy examples of the breed, who come to us\nexpecting that their plotting has already been done for them--but it's\ninherent in the way we operate, and there it is.\n\nCertainly nobody at CIA so much as thought of Braun when the news first\ncame through. Harry Anderton, the Harbor Defense chief, called us at\n0830 Friday to take on the job of identifying the egg; this was when our\nrecords show us officially entering the affair, but, of course, Anderton\nhad been keeping the wires to Washington steaming for an hour before\nthat, getting authorization to spend some of his money on us (our\nclearance status was then and is now C&R--clean and routine).\n\nI was in the central office when the call came through, and had some\ndifficulty in making out precisely what Anderton wanted of us. \"Slow\ndown, Colonel Anderton, please,\" I begged him. \"Two or three seconds\nwon't make that much difference. How did you find out about this egg in\nthe first place?\"\n\n\"The automatic compartment bulkheads on the _Ludmilla_ were defective,\"\nhe said. \"It seems that this egg was buried among a lot of other crates\nin the dump-cell of the hold--\"\n\n\"What's a dump cell?\"\n\n\"It's a sea lock for getting rid of dangerous cargo. The bottom of it\nopens right to Davy Jones. Standard fitting for ships carrying\nexplosives, radioactives, anything that might act up unexpectedly.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Well, there was a timer on the dump-cell floor, set to drop the egg\nwhen the ship came up the river. That worked fine, but the automatic\nbulkheads that are supposed to keep the rest of the ship from being\nflooded while the cell's open, didn't. At least they didn't do a\nthorough job. The _Ludmilla_ began to list and the captain yelled for\nhelp. When the Harbor Patrol found the dump-cell open, they called us\nin.\"\n\n\"I see.\" I thought about it a moment. \"In other words, you don't know\nwhether the _Ludmilla_ really laid an egg or not.\"\n\n\"That's what I keep trying to explain to you, Dr. Harris. We don't know\nwhat she dropped and we haven't any way of finding out. It could be a\nbomb--it could be anything. We're sweating everybody on board the ship\nnow, but it's my guess that none of them know anything; the whole\nprocedure was designed to be automatic.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll take it,\" I said. \"You've got divers down?\"\n\n\"Sure, but--\"\n\n\"We'll worry about the buts from here on. Get us a direct line from\nyour barge to the big board here so we can direct the work. Better get\non over here yourself.\"\n\n\"Right.\" He sounded relieved. Official people have a lot of confidence\nin CIA; too much, in my estimation. Some day the job will come along\nthat we can't handle, and then Washington will be kicking itself--or,\nmore likely, some scapegoat--for having failed to develop a comparable\ngovernment department.\n\nNot that there was much prospect of Washington's doing that. Official\nthinking had been running in the other direction for years. The\nprecedent was the Associated Universities organization which ran\nBrookhaven; CIA had been started the same way, by a loose corporation of\nuniversities and industries all of which had wanted to own an ULTIMAC\nand no one of which had had the money to buy one for itself. The\nEisenhower administration, with its emphasis on private enterprise and\nconcomitant reluctance to sink federal funds into projects of such size,\nhad turned the two examples into a nice fat trend, which ULTIMAC herself\nsaid wasn't going to be reversed within the practicable lifetime of CIA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI buzzed for two staffers, and in five minutes got Clark Cheyney and\nJoan Hadamard, CIA's business manager and social science division chief\nrespectively. The titles were almost solely for the benefit of the\nT/O--that is, Clark and Joan do serve in those capacities, but said\nservice takes about two per cent of their capacities and their time. I\nshot them a couple of sentences of explanation, trusting them to pick up\nwhatever else they needed from the tape, and checked the line to the\ndivers' barge.\n\nIt was already open; Anderton had gone to work quickly and with decision\nonce he was sure we were taking on the major question. The television\nscreen lit, but nothing showed on it but murky light, striped with\nstreamers of darkness slowly rising and falling. The audio went\n_cloonck_ ... _oing_, _oing_ ... _bonk_ ... _oing_ ... Underwater\nnoises, shapeless and characterless.\n\n\"Hello, out there in the harbor. This is CIA, Harris calling. Come in,\nplease.\"\n\n\"Monig here,\" the audio said. _Boink_ ... _oing_, _oing_ ...\n\n\"Got anything yet?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Dr. Harris,\" Monig said. \"You can't see three inches in\nfront of your face down here--it's too silty. We've bumped into a couple\nof crates, but so far, no egg.\"\n\n\"Keep trying.\"\n\nCheyney, looking even more like a bulldog than usual, was setting his\nstopwatch by one of the eight clocks on ULTIMAC's face. \"Want me to take\nthe divers?\" he said.\n\n\"No, Clark, not yet. I'd rather have Joan do it for the moment.\" I\npassed the mike to her. \"You'd better run a probability series first.\"\n\n\"Check.\" He began feeding tape into the integrator's mouth. \"What's your\nangle, Peter?\"\n\n\"The ship. I want to see how heavily shielded that dump-cell is.\"\n\n\"It isn't shielded at all,\" Anderton's voice said behind me. I hadn't\nheard him come in. \"But that doesn't prove anything. The egg might have\ncarried sufficient shielding in itself. Or maybe the Commies didn't care\nwhether the crew was exposed or not. Or maybe there isn't any egg.\"\n\n\"All that's possible,\" I admitted. \"But I want to see it, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Have you taken blood tests?\" Joan asked Anderton.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Get the reports through to me, then. I want white-cell counts,\ndifferentials, platelet counts, hematocrit and sed rates on every man.\"\n\nAnderton picked up the phone and I took a firm hold on the doorknob.\n\n\"Hey,\" Anderton said, putting the phone down again. \"Are you going to\nduck out just like that? Remember, Dr. Harris, we've got to evacuate the\ncity first of all! No matter whether it's a real egg or not--we can't\ntake the chance on it's _not_ being an egg!\"\n\n\"Don't move a man until you get a go-ahead from CIA,\" I said. \"For all\nwe know now, evacuating the city may be just what the enemy wants us to\ndo--so they can grab it unharmed. Or they may want to start a panic for\nsome other reason, any one of fifty possible reasons.\"\n\n\"You can't take such a gamble,\" he said grimly. \"There are eight and a\nhalf million lives riding on it. I can't let you do it.\"\n\n\"You passed your authority to us when you hired us,\" I pointed out. \"If\nyou want to evacuate without our O.K., you'll have to fire us first.\nIt'll take another hour to get that cleared from Washington--so you\nmight as well give us the hour.\"\n\nHe stared at me for a moment, his lips thinned. Then he picked up the\nphone again to order Joan's blood count, and I got out the door, fast.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA reasonable man would have said that I found nothing useful on the\n_Ludmilla_, except negative information. But the fact is that anything I\nfound would have been a surprise to me; I went down looking for\nsurprises. I found nothing but a faint trail to Abner Longmans Braun,\nmost of which was fifteen years cold.\n\nThere'd been a time when I'd known Braun, briefly and to no profit to\neither of us. As an undergraduate majoring in social sciences, I'd taken\non a term paper on the old International Longshoreman's Association, a\nracket-ridden union now formally extinct--although anyone who knew the\nsigns could still pick up some traces on the docks. In those days, Braun\nhad been the business manager of an insurance firm, the sole visible\nfunction of which had been to write policies for the ILA and its\nindividual dock-wallopers. For some reason, he had been amused by the\nbrash youngster who'd barged in on him and demanded the lowdown, and had\nshown me considerable lengths of ropes not normally in view of the\npublic--nothing incriminating, but enough to give me a better insight\ninto how the union operated than I had had any right to expect--or even\nsuspect.\n\nHence I was surprised to hear somebody on the docks remark that Braun\nwas in the city over the week end. It would never have occurred to me\nthat he still interested himself in the waterfront, for he'd gone\nrespectable with a vengeance. He was still a professional gambler, and\naccording to what he had told the Congressional Investigating Committee\nlast year, took in thirty to fifty thousand dollars a year at it, but\nhis gambles were no longer concentrated on horses, the numbers, or shady\ninsurance deals. Nowadays what he did was called investment--mostly in\nreal estate; realtors knew him well as the man who had _almost_ bought\nthe Empire State Building. (The _almost_ in the equation stands for the\nmoment when the shoestring broke.)\n\nJoan had been following his career, too, not because she had ever met\nhim, but because for her he was a type study in the evolution of what\nshe called \"the extra-legal ego.\" \"With personalities like that,\nrespectability is a disease,\" she told me. \"There's always an\nalmost-open conflict between the desire to be powerful and the desire to\nbe accepted; your ordinary criminal is a moral imbecile, but people like\nBraun are damned with a conscience, and sooner or later they crack\ntrying to appease it.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner try to crack a Timkin bearing,\" I said. \"Braun's ten-point\nsteel all the way through.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it. The symptoms are showing all over him. Now he's\nbacking Broadway plays, sponsoring beginning actresses, joining\nplaywrights' groups--he's the only member of Buskin and Brush who's\nnever written a play, acted in one, or so much as pulled the rope to\nraise the curtain.\"\n\n\"That's investment,\" I said. \"That's his business.\"\n\n\"Peter, you're only looking at the surface. His real investments almost\nnever fail. But the plays he backs _always_ do. They have to; he's\nsinking money in them to appease his conscience, and if they were to\nsucceed it would double his guilt instead of salving it. It's the same\nway with the young actresses. He's not sexually interested in them--his\ntype never is, because living a rigidly orthodox family life is part of\nthe effort towards respectability. He's backing them to 'pay his debt to\nsociety'--in other words, they're talismans to keep him out of jail.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem like a very satisfactory substitute.\"\n\n\"Of course it isn't,\" Joan had said. \"The next thing he'll do is go in\nfor direct public service--giving money to hospitals or something like\nthat. You watch.\"\n\nShe had been right; within the year, Braun had announced the founding of\nan association for clearing the Detroit slum area where he had been\nborn--the plainest kind of symbolic suicide: _Let's not have any more\nAbner Longmans Brauns born down here_. It depressed me to see it happen,\nfor next on Joan's agenda for Braun was an entry into politics as a\nfighting liberal--a New Dealer twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly\nliberal myself when I'm off duty, I hated to think what Braun's career\nmight tell me about my own motives, if I'd let it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll of which had nothing to do with why I was prowling around the\n_Ludmilla_--or did it? I kept remembering Anderton's challenge: \"You\ncan't take such a gamble. There are eight and a half million lives\nriding on it--\" That put it up into Braun's normal operating area, all\nright. The connection was still hazy, but on the grounds that any link\nmight be useful, I phoned him.\n\nHe remembered me instantly; like most uneducated, power-driven men, he\nhad a memory as good as any machine's.\n\n\"You never did send me that paper you was going to write,\" he said. His\nvoice seemed absolutely unchanged, although he was in his seventies now.\n\"You promised you would.\"\n\n\"Kids don't keep their promises as well as they should,\" I said. \"But\nI've still got copies and I'll see to it that you get one, this time.\nRight now I need another favor--something right up your alley.\"\n\n\"CIA business?\"\n\n\"Yes. I didn't know you knew I was with CIA.\"\n\nBraun chuckled. \"I still know a thing or two,\" he said. \"What's the\nangle?\"\n\n\"That I can't tell you over the phone. But it's the biggest gamble there\never was, and I think we need an expert. Can you come down to CIA's\ncentral headquarters right away?\"\n\n\"Yeah, if it's that big. If it ain't, I got lots of business here, Andy.\nAnd I ain't going to be in town long. You're sure it's top stuff?\"\n\n\"My word on it.\"\n\nHe was silent a moment. Then he said, \"Andy, send me your paper.\"\n\n\"The paper? Sure, but--\" Then I got it. I'd given him my word. \"You'll\nget it,\" I said. \"Thanks, Mr. Braun.\"\n\nI called headquarters and sent a messenger to my apartment to look for\none of those long-dusty blue folders with the legal-length sheets inside\nthem, with orders to scorch it over to Braun without stopping to breathe\nmore than once. Then I went back myself.\n\nThe atmosphere had changed. Anderton was sitting by the big desk,\nclenching his fists and sweating; his whole posture telegraphed his\ncontrolled helplessness. Cheyney was bent over a seismograph,\necho-sounding for the egg through the river bottom. If that even had a\nprayer of working, I knew, he'd have had the trains of the Hudson &\nManhattan stopped; their rumbling course through their tubes would have\nblanked out any possible echo-pip from the egg.\n\n\"Wild goose chase?\" Joan said, scanning my face.\n\n\"Not quite. I've got something, if I can just figure out what it is.\nRemember One-Shot Braun?\"\n\n\"Yes. What's he got to do with it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"But I want to bring him in. I don't think we'll lick\nthis project before deadline without him.\"\n\n\"What good is a professional gambler on a job like this? He'll just get\nin the way.\"\n\nI looked toward the television screen, which now showed an amorphous\nblack mass, jutting up from a foundation of even deeper black. \"Is that\noperation getting you anywhere?\"\n\n\"Nothing's gotten us anywhere,\" Anderton interjected harshly. \"We don't\neven know if that's the egg--the whole area is littered with crates.\nHarris, you've got to let me get that alert out!\"\n\n\"Clark, how's the time going?\"\n\nCheyney consulted the stopwatch. \"Deadline in twenty-nine minutes,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"All right, let's use those minutes. I'm beginning to see this thing a\nlittle clearer. Joan, what we've got here is a one-shot gamble; right?\"\n\n\"In effect,\" she said cautiously.\n\n\"And it's my guess that we're never going to get the answer by diving\nfor it--not in time, anyhow. Remember when the Navy lost a barge-load of\nshells in the harbor, back in '52? They scrabbled for them for a year\nand never pulled up a one; they finally had to warn the public that if\nit found anything funny-looking along the shore it shouldn't bang said\nobject, or shake it either. We're better equipped than the Navy was\nthen--but we're working against a deadline.\"\n\n\"If you'd admitted that earlier,\" Anderton said hoarsely, \"we'd have\nhalf a million people out of the city by now. Maybe even a million.\"\n\n\"We haven't given up yet, colonel. The point is this, Joan: what we need\nis an inspired guess. Get anything from the prob series, Clark? I\nthought not. On a one-shot gamble of this kind, the 'laws' of chance are\nno good at all. For that matter, the so-called ESP experiments showed us\nlong ago that even the way we construct random tables is full of\nholes--and that a man with a feeling for the essence of a gamble can\nmake a monkey out of chance almost at will.\n\n\"And if there ever was such a man, Braun is it. That's why I asked him\nto come down here. I want him to look at that lump on the screen\nand--play a hunch.\"\n\n\"You're out of your mind,\" Anderton said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA decorous knock spared me the trouble of having to deny, affirm or\nignore the judgment. It was Braun; the messenger had been fast, and the\ngambler hadn't bothered to read what a college student had thought of\nhim fifteen years ago. He came forward and held out his hand, while the\nothers looked him over frankly.\n\nHe was impressive, all right. It would have been hard for a stranger to\nbelieve that he was aiming at respectability; to the eye, he was already\nthere. He was tall and spare, and walked perfectly erect, not without\nspring despite his age. His clothing was as far from that of a gambler\nas you could have taken it by design: a black double-breasted suit with\na thin vertical stripe, a gray silk tie with a pearl stickpin just\nbarely large enough to be visible at all, a black Homburg; all perfectly\nfitted, all worn with proper casualness--one might almost say a formal\ncasualness. It was only when he opened his mouth that One-Shot Braun was\nin the suit with him.\n\n\"I come over as soon as your runner got to me,\" he said. \"What's the\npitch, Andy?\"\n\n\"Mr. Braun, this is Joan Hadamard, Clark Cheyney, Colonel Anderton. I'll\nbe quick because we need speed now. A Polish ship has dropped something\nout in the harbor. We don't know what it is. It may be a hell-bomb, or\nit may be just somebody's old laundry. Obviously we've got to find out\nwhich--and we want you to tell us.\"\n\nBraun's aristocratic eyebrows went up. \"Me? Hell, Andy, I don't know\nnothing about things like that. I'm surprised with you. I thought CIA\nhad all the brains it needed--ain't you got machines to tell you answers\nlike that?\"\n\nI pointed silently to Joan, who had gone back to work the moment the\nintroductions were over. She was still on the mike to the divers. She\nwas saying: \"What does it look like?\"\n\n\"It's just a lump of something, Dr. Hadamard. Can't even tell its\nshape--it's buried too deeply in the mud.\" _Cloonk_ ... _Oing_, _oing_\n...\n\n\"Try the Geiger.\"\n\n\"We did. Nothing but background.\"\n\n\"Scintillation counter?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Dr. Hadamard. Could be it's shielded.\"\n\n\"Let us do the guessing, Monig. All right, maybe it's got a clockwork\nfuse that didn't break with the impact. Or a gyroscopic fuse. Stick a\nstethoscope on it and see if you pick up a ticking or anything that\nsounds like a motor running.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a lag and I turned back to Braun. \"As you can see, we're\nstymied. This is a long shot, Mr. Braun. One throw of the dice--one\nshow-down hand. We've got to have an expert call it for us--somebody\nwith a record of hits on long shots. That's why I called you.\"\n\n\"It's no good,\" he said. He took off the Homburg, took his handkerchief\nfrom his breast pocket, and wiped the hatband. \"I can't do it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It ain't my _kind_ of thing,\" he said. \"Look, I never in my life run\nodds on anything that made any difference. But this makes a difference.\nIf I guess wrong--\"\n\n\"Then we're all dead ducks. But why should you guess wrong? Your hunches\nhave been working for sixty years now.\"\n\nBraun wiped his face. \"No. You don't get it. I wish you'd listen to me.\nLook, my wife and my kids are in the city. It ain't only my life, it's\ntheirs, too. That's what I care about. That's why it's no good. On\nthings that matter to me, _my hunches don't work_.\"\n\nI was stunned, and so, I could see, were Joan and Cheyney. I suppose I\nshould have guessed it, but it had never occurred to me.\n\n\"Ten minutes,\" Cheyney said.\n\nI looked up at Braun. He was frightened, and again I was surprised\nwithout having any right to be. I tried to keep at least my voice calm.\n\n\"Please try it anyhow, Mr. Braun--as a favor. It's already too late to\ndo it any other way. And if you guess wrong, the outcome won't be any\nworse than if you don't try at all.\"\n\n\"My kids,\" he whispered. I don't think he knew that he was speaking\naloud. I waited.\n\nThen his eyes seemed to come back to the present. \"All right,\" he said.\n\"I told you the truth, Andy. Remember that. So--is it a bomb or ain't\nit? That's what's up for grabs, right?\"\n\nI nodded. He closed his eyes. An unexpected stab of pure fright went\ndown my back. Without the eyes, Braun's face was a death mask.\n\nThe water sounds and the irregular ticking of a Geiger counter seemed to\nspring out from the audio speaker, four times as loud as before. I could\neven hear the pen of the seismograph scribbling away, until I looked at\nthe instrument and saw that Clark had stopped it, probably long ago.\n\nDroplets of sweat began to form along Braun's forehead and his upper\nlip. The handkerchief remained crushed in his hand.\n\nAnderton said, \"Of all the fool--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" Joan said quietly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly, Braun opened his eyes. \"All right,\" he said. \"You guys wanted it\nthis way. _I say it's a bomb._\" He stared at us for a moment more--and\nthen, all at once, the Timkin bearing burst. Words poured out of it.\n\"Now you guys do something, do your job like I did mine--get my wife and\nkids out of there--empty the city--do something, _do something_!\"\n\nAnderton was already grabbing for the phone. \"You're right, Mr. Braun.\nIf it isn't already too late--\"\n\nCheyney shot out a hand and caught Anderton's telephone arm by the\nwrist. \"Wait a minute,\" he said.\n\n\"What d'you mean, 'wait a minute'? Haven't you already shot enough\ntime?\"\n\nCheyney did not let go; instead, he looked inquiringly at Joan and said,\n\"One minute, Joan. You might as well go ahead.\"\n\nShe nodded and spoke into the mike. \"Monig, unscrew the cap.\"\n\n\"Unscrew the cap?\" the audio squawked. \"But Dr. Hadamard, if that sets\nit off--\"\n\n\"It won't go off. That's the one thing you can be sure it won't do.\"\n\n\"What is this?\" Anderton demanded. \"And what's this deadline stuff,\nanyhow?\"\n\n\"The cap's off,\" Monig reported. \"We're getting plenty of radiation now.\nJust a minute-- Yeah. Dr. Hadamard, it's a bomb, all right. But it\nhasn't got a fuse. Now how could they have made a fool mistake like\nthat?\"\n\n\"In other words, it's a dud,\" Joan said.\n\n\"That's right, a dud.\"\n\nNow, at last, Braun wiped his face, which was quite gray. \"I told you\nthe truth,\" he said grimly. \"My hunches don't work on stuff like this.\"\n\n\"But they do,\" I said. \"I'm sorry we put you through the wringer--and\nyou too, colonel--but we couldn't let an opportunity like this slip. It\nwas too good a chance for us to test how our facilities would stand up\nin a real bomb-drop.\"\n\n\"A real drop?\" Anderton said. \"Are you trying to say that CIA staged\nthis? You ought to be shot, the whole pack of you!\"\n\n\"No, not exactly,\" I said. \"The enemy's responsible for the drop, all\nright. We got word last month from our man in Gdynia that they were\ngoing to do it, and that the bomb would be on board the _Ludmilla_. As I\nsay, it was too good an opportunity to miss. We wanted to find out just\nhow long it would take us to figure out the nature of the bomb--which we\ndidn't know in detail--after it was dropped here. So we had our people\nin Gdynia defuse the thing after it was put on board the ship, but\notherwise leave it entirely alone.\n\n\"Actually, you see, your hunch was right on the button as far as it\nwent. We didn't ask you whether or not that object was a live bomb. We\nasked whether it was a bomb or not. You said it was, and you were\nright.\"\n\nThe expression on Braun's face was exactly like the one he had worn\nwhile he had been searching for his decision--except that, since his\neyes were open, I could see that it was directed at me. \"If this was the\nold days,\" he said in an ice-cold voice, \"I might of made the colonel's\nidea come true. I don't go for tricks like this, Andy.\"\n\n\"It was more than a trick,\" Clark put in. \"You'll remember we had a\ndeadline on the test, Mr. Braun. Obviously, in a real drop we wouldn't\nhave all the time in the world to figure out what kind of a thing had\nbeen dropped. If we had still failed to establish that when the deadline\nran out, we would have had to allow evacuation of the city, with all the\nattendant risk that that was exactly what the enemy wanted us to do.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So we failed the test,\" I said. \"At one minute short of the deadline,\nJoan had the divers unscrew the cap. In a real drop that would have\nresulted in a detonation, if the bomb was real; we'd never risk it. That\nwe did do it in the test was a concession of failure--an admission that\nour usual methods didn't come through for us in time.\n\n\"And that means that you were the only person who did come through, Mr.\nBraun. If a real bomb-drop ever comes, we're going to have to have you\nhere, as an active part of our investigation. Your intuition for the\none-shot gamble was the one thing that bailed us out this time. Next\ntime it may save eight million lives.\"\n\nThere was quite a long silence. All of us, Anderton included, watched\nBraun intently, but his impassive face failed to show any trace of how\nhis thoughts were running.\n\nWhen he did speak at last, what he said must have seemed insanely\nirrelevant to Anderton, and maybe to Cheyney too. And perhaps it meant\nnothing more to Joan than the final clinical note in a case history.\n\n\"It's funny,\" he said, \"I was thinking of running for Congress next year\nfrom my district. But maybe this is more important.\"\n\nIt was, I believe, the sigh of a man at peace with himself.\n\n\nFIN\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note\n\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ August\n    1955.

Shaw describes Henry Apjohn as \"a very beautiful youth, moving as in a dream, walking as on air,\" while Aurora Bompas has \"an air of being a young and beautiful woman but as a matter of hard fact, she is, dress and pretensions apart, a very ordinary South Kensington female of about 37, hopelessly inferior in physical and spiritual distinction to the beautiful youth.\" The third character is Aurora's husband Teddy, \"a robust, thicknecked, well groomed city man, with a strong chin but a blithering eye and credulous mouth.\"\nAurora is distressed because she has misplaced some poems, in which she is identified by name, written for her with declarations of love by the impetuous Henry. She suspects her sister-in-law Georgina stole them from her workbox and is concerned she will read them to Aurora's husband Teddy.\nHenry suggests they confront Teddy with the truth, \"quietly, hand in hand\" and depart - \"without concealment and subterfuge, freely and honestly, in full honor and self-respect\" - for their planned evening at the theatre. (Henry has purchased tickets for Candida - the popular Shaw comedy which Henry and Aurora's situation closely resembles - because Lohengrin was sold out.) The two engage in a discussion about the merits of revealing their affair until Teddy arrives and confronts Henry with his poetry.\nThe young man tries to convince him they were inspired by Aurora, the goddess of dawn, rather than his wife, and assures him he has no interest in the woman Teddy married . . . which the cuckolded man finds so insulting he demands Henry admit how desirable Aurora is. Henry finally confesses his love for Aurora, which pleases Teddy so much he proposes he have the poems published on \"the finest paper, sumptuous binding, everything first class\" as a tribute to his wife. \"What shall we call the volume?,\" Teddy asks. \"To Aurora, or something like that, eh?,\" to which Henry replies, \"I should call it How He Lied to Her Husband.\"", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK HOW HE LIED TO HER HUSBAND ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Eve Sobol\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW HE LIED TO HER HUSBAND\n\n\nBy George Bernard Shaw\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nLike many other works of mine, this playlet is a piece d'occasion. In\n1905 it happened that Mr Arnold Daly, who was then playing the part of\nNapoleon in The Man of Destiny in New York, found that whilst the play\nwas too long to take a secondary place in the evening's performance, it\nwas too short to suffice by itself. I therefore took advantage of four\ndays continuous rain during a holiday in the north of Scotland to write\nHow He Lied To Her Husband for Mr Daly. In his hands, it served its turn\nvery effectively.\n\nI print it here as a sample of what can be done with even the most\nhackneyed stage framework by filling it in with an observed touch of\nactual humanity instead of with doctrinaire romanticism. Nothing in the\ntheatre is staler than the situation of husband, wife and lover, or the\nfun of knockabout farce. I have taken both, and got an original play\nout of them, as anybody else can if only he will look about him for his\nmaterial instead of plagiarizing Othello and the thousand plays that\nhave proceeded on Othello's romantic assumptions and false point of\nhonor.\n\nA further experiment made by Mr Arnold Daly with this play is worth\nrecording. In 1905 Mr Daly produced Mrs Warren's Profession in New York.\nThe press of that city instantly raised a cry that such persons as Mrs\nWarren are \"ordure,\" and should not be mentioned in the presence\nof decent people. This hideous repudiation of humanity and social\nconscience so took possession of the New York journalists that the\nfew among them who kept their feet morally and intellectually could do\nnothing to check the epidemic of foul language, gross suggestion,\nand raving obscenity of word and thought that broke out. The writers\nabandoned all self-restraint under the impression that they were\nupholding virtue instead of outraging it. They infected each other with\ntheir hysteria until they were for all practical purposes indecently\nmad. They finally forced the police to arrest Mr Daly and his company,\nand led the magistrate to express his loathing of the duty thus forced\nupon him of reading an unmentionable and abominable play. Of course the\nconvulsion soon exhausted itself. The magistrate, naturally somewhat\nimpatient when he found that what he had to read was a strenuously\nethical play forming part of a book which had been in circulation\nunchallenged for eight years, and had been received without protest by\nthe whole London and New York press, gave the journalists a piece of his\nmind as to their moral taste in plays. By consent, he passed the case\non to a higher court, which declared that the play was not immoral;\nacquitted Mr Daly; and made an end of the attempt to use the law to\ndeclare living women to be \"ordure,\" and thus enforce silence as to\nthe far-reaching fact that you cannot cheapen women in the market for\nindustrial purposes without cheapening them for other purposes as well.\nI hope Mrs Warren's Profession will be played everywhere, in season and\nout of season, until Mrs Warren has bitten that fact into the public\nconscience, and shamed the newspapers which support a tariff to keep\nup the price of every American commodity except American manhood and\nwomanhood.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr Daly had already suffered the usual fate of those who\ndirect public attention to the profits of the sweater or the pleasures\nof the voluptuary. He was morally lynched side by side with me. Months\nelapsed before the decision of the courts vindicated him; and even then,\nsince his vindication implied the condemnation of the press, which was\nby that time sober again, and ashamed of its orgy, his triumph received\na rather sulky and grudging publicity. In the meantime he had hardly\nbeen able to approach an American city, including even those cities\nwhich had heaped applause on him as the defender of hearth and home when\nhe produced Candida, without having to face articles discussing whether\nmothers could allow their daughters to attend such plays as You Never\nCan Tell, written by the infamous author of Mrs Warren's Profession, and\nacted by the monster who produced it. What made this harder to bear was\nthat though no fact is better established in theatrical business than\nthe financial disastrousness of moral discredit, the journalists who had\ndone all the mischief kept paying vice the homage of assuming that it\nis enormously popular and lucrative, and that I and Mr Daly, being\nexploiters of vice, must therefore be making colossal fortunes out of\nthe abuse heaped on us, and had in fact provoked it and welcomed it with\nthat express object. Ignorance of real life could hardly go further.\n\nOne consequence was that Mr Daly could not have kept his financial\nengagements or maintained his hold on the public had he not accepted\nengagements to appear for a season in the vaudeville theatres [the\nAmerican equivalent of our music halls], where he played How He Lied\nto Her Husband comparatively unhampered by the press censorship of\nthe theatre, or by that sophistication of the audience through press\nsuggestion from which I suffer more, perhaps, than any other author.\nVaudeville authors are fortunately unknown: the audiences see what the\nplay contains and what the actor can do, not what the papers have told\nthem to expect. Success under such circumstances had a value both for Mr\nDaly and myself which did something to console us for the very unsavory\nmobbing which the New York press organized for us, and which was not the\nless disgusting because we suffered in a good cause and in the very best\ncompany.\n\nMr Daly, having weathered the storm, can perhaps shake his soul free\nof it as he heads for fresh successes with younger authors. But I have\ncertain sensitive places in my soul: I do not like that word \"ordure.\"\nApply it to my work, and I can afford to smile, since the world, on the\nwhole, will smile with me. But to apply it to the woman in the street,\nwhose spirit is of one substance with our own and her body no less holy:\nto look your women folk in the face afterwards and not go out and hang\nyourself: that is not on the list of pardonable sins.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT. Since the above was written news has arrived from America\nthat a leading New York newspaper, which was among the most abusively\nclamorous for the suppression of Mrs Warren's Profession, has just been\nfined heavily for deriving part of its revenue from advertisements of\nMrs Warren's houses.\n\nMany people have been puzzled by the fact that whilst stage\nentertainments which are frankly meant to act on the spectators as\naphrodisiacs, are everywhere tolerated, plays which have an almost\nhorrifyingly contrary effect are fiercely attacked by persons and papers\nnotoriously indifferent to public morals on all other occasions. The\nexplanation is very simple. The profits of Mrs Warren's profession\nare shared not only by Mrs Warren and Sir George Crofts, but by the\nlandlords of their houses, the newspapers which advertize them, the\nrestaurants which cater for them, and, in short, all the trades to\nwhich they are good customers, not to mention the public officials\nand representatives whom they silence by complicity, corruption, or\nblackmail. Add to these the employers who profit by cheap female labor,\nand the shareholders whose dividends depend on it [you find such people\neverywhere, even on the judicial bench and in the highest places in\nChurch and State], and you get a large and powerful class with a\nstrong pecuniary incentive to protect Mrs Warren's profession, and a\ncorrespondingly strong incentive to conceal, from their own consciences\nno less than from the world, the real sources of their gain. These are\nthe people who declare that it is feminine vice and not poverty that\ndrives women to the streets, as if vicious women with independent\nincomes ever went there. These are the people who, indulgent or\nindifferent to aphrodisiac plays, raise the moral hue and cry against\nperformances of Mrs Warren's Profession, and drag actresses to the\npolice court to be insulted, bullied, and threatened for fulfilling\ntheir engagements. For please observe that the judicial decision in New\nYork State in favor of the play does not end the matter. In Kansas City,\nfor instance, the municipality, finding itself restrained by the courts\nfrom preventing the performance, fell back on a local bye-law against\nindecency to evade the Constitution of the United States. They summoned\nthe actress who impersonated Mrs Warren to the police court, and offered\nher and her colleagues the alternative of leaving the city or being\nprosecuted under this bye-law.\n\nNow nothing is more possible than that the city councillors who suddenly\ndisplayed such concern for the morals of the theatre were either Mrs\nWarren's landlords, or employers of women at starvation wages, or\nrestaurant keepers, or newspaper proprietors, or in some other more\nor less direct way sharers of the profits of her trade. No doubt it\nis equally possible that they were simply stupid men who thought that\nindecency consists, not in evil, but in mentioning it. I have, however,\nbeen myself a member of a municipal council, and have not found\nmunicipal councillors quite so simple and inexperienced as this. At all\nevents I do not propose to give the Kansas councillors the benefit of\nthe doubt. I therefore advise the public at large, which will finally\ndecide the matter, to keep a vigilant eye on gentlemen who will stand\nanything at the theatre except a performance of Mrs Warren's Profession,\nand who assert in the same breath that [a] the play is too loathsome to\nbe bearable by civilized people, and [b] that unless its performance\nis prohibited the whole town will throng to see it. They may be merely\nexcited and foolish; but I am bound to warn the public that it is\nequally likely that they may be collected and knavish.\n\nAt all events, to prohibit the play is to protect the evil which the\nplay exposes; and in view of that fact, I see no reason for assuming\nthat the prohibitionists are disinterested moralists, and that\nthe author, the managers, and the performers, who depend for\ntheir livelihood on their personal reputations and not on rents,\nadvertisements, or dividends, are grossly inferior to them in moral\nsense and public responsibility.\n\nIt is true that in Mrs Warren's Profession, Society, and not any\nindividual, is the villain of the piece; but it does not follow that\nthe people who take offence at it are all champions of society. Their\ncredentials cannot be too carefully examined.\n\n\n\n\nHOW HE LIED TO HER HUSBAND\n\nIt is eight o'clock in the evening. The curtains are drawn and the lamps\nlighted in the drawing room of Her flat in Cromwell Road. Her lover, a\nbeautiful youth of eighteen, in evening dress and cape, with a bunch of\nflowers and an opera hat in his hands, comes in alone. The door is near\nthe corner; and as he appears in the doorway, he has the fireplace on\nthe nearest wall to his right, and the grand piano along the opposite\nwall to his left. Near the fireplace a small ornamental table has on it\na hand mirror, a fan, a pair of long white gloves, and a little white\nwoollen cloud to wrap a woman's head in. On the other side of the room,\nnear the piano, is a broad, square, softly up-holstered stool. The room\nis furnished in the most approved South Kensington fashion: that is, it\nis as like a show room as possible, and is intended to demonstrate the\nracial position and spending powers of its owners, and not in the least\nto make them comfortable.\n\nHe is, be it repeated, a very beautiful youth, moving as in a dream,\nwalking as on air. He puts his flowers down carefully on the table\nbeside the fan; takes off his cape, and, as there is no room on the\ntable for it, takes it to the piano; puts his hat on the cape; crosses\nto the hearth; looks at his watch; puts it up again; notices the things\non the table; lights up as if he saw heaven opening before him; goes to\nthe table and takes the cloud in both hands, nestling his nose into its\nsoftness and kissing it; kisses the gloves one after another; kisses the\nfan: gasps a long shuddering sigh of ecstasy; sits down on the stool and\npresses his hands to his eyes to shut out reality and dream a little;\ntakes his hands down and shakes his head with a little smile of rebuke\nfor his folly; catches sight of a speck of dust on his shoes and hastily\nand carefully brushes it off with his handkerchief; rises and takes\nthe hand mirror from the table to make sure of his tie with the gravest\nanxiety; and is looking at his watch again when She comes in, much\nflustered. As she is dressed for the theatre; has spoilt, petted ways;\nand wears many diamonds, she has an air of being a young and beautiful\nwoman; but as a matter of hard fact, she is, dress and pretensions\napart, a very ordinary South Kensington female of about 37, hopelessly\ninferior in physical and spiritual distinction to the beautiful youth,\nwho hastily puts down the mirror as she enters.\n\nHE [kissing her hand] At last!\n\nSHE. Henry: something dreadful has happened.\n\nHE. What's the matter?\n\nSHE. I have lost your poems.\n\nHE. They were unworthy of you. I will write you some more.\n\nSHE. No, thank you. Never any more poems for me. Oh, how could I have\nbeen so mad! so rash! so imprudent!\n\nHE. Thank Heaven for your madness, your rashness, your imprudence!\n\nSHE [impatiently] Oh, be sensible, Henry. Can't you see what a terrible\nthing this is for me? Suppose anybody finds these poems! what will they\nthink?\n\nHE. They will think that a man once loved a woman more devotedly than\never man loved woman before. But they will not know what man it was.\n\nSHE. What good is that to me if everybody will know what woman it was?\n\nHE. But how will they know?\n\nSHE. How will they know! Why, my name is all over them: my silly,\nunhappy name. Oh, if I had only been christened Mary Jane, or Gladys\nMuriel, or Beatrice, or Francesca, or Guinevere, or something quite\ncommon! But Aurora! Aurora! I'm the only Aurora in London; and everybody\nknows it. I believe I'm the only Aurora in the world. And it's so\nhorribly easy to rhyme to it! Oh, Henry, why didn't you try to restrain\nyour feelings a little in common consideration for me? Why didn't you\nwrite with some little reserve?\n\nHE. Write poems to you with reserve! You ask me that!\n\nSHE [with perfunctory tenderness] Yes, dear, of course it was very nice\nof you; and I know it was my own fault as much as yours. I ought to have\nnoticed that your verses ought never to have been addressed to a married\nwoman.\n\nHE. Ah, how I wish they had been addressed to an unmarried woman! how I\nwish they had!\n\nSHE. Indeed you have no right to wish anything of the sort. They are\nquite unfit for anybody but a married woman. That's just the difficulty.\nWhat will my sisters-in-law think of them?\n\nHE [painfully jarred] Have you got sisters-in-law?\n\nSHE. Yes, of course I have. Do you suppose I am an angel?\n\nHE [biting his lips] I do. Heaven help me, I do--or I did--or [he almost\nchokes a sob].\n\nSHE [softening and putting her hand caressingly on his shoulder] Listen\nto me, dear. It's very nice of you to live with me in a dream, and to\nlove me, and so on; but I can't help my husband having disagreeable\nrelatives, can I?\n\nHE [brightening up] Ah, of course they are your husband's relatives: I\nforgot that. Forgive me, Aurora. [He takes her hand from his shoulder\nand kisses it. She sits down on the stool. He remains near the table,\nwith his back to it, smiling fatuously down at her].\n\nSHE. The fact is, Teddy's got nothing but relatives. He has eight\nsisters and six half-sisters, and ever so many brothers--but I don't\nmind his brothers. Now if you only knew the least little thing about\nthe world, Henry, you'd know that in a large family, though the sisters\nquarrel with one another like mad all the time, yet let one of the\nbrothers marry, and they all turn on their unfortunate sister-in-law and\ndevote the rest of their lives with perfect unanimity to persuading\nhim that his wife is unworthy of him. They can do it to her very face\nwithout her knowing it, because there are always a lot of stupid low\nfamily jokes that nobody understands but themselves. Half the time you\ncan't tell what they're talking about: it just drives you wild. There\nought to be a law against a man's sister ever entering his house after\nhe's married. I'm as certain as that I'm sitting here that Georgina\nstole those poems out of my workbox.\n\nHE. She will not understand them, I think.\n\nSHE. Oh, won't she! She'll understand them only too well. She'll\nunderstand more harm than ever was in them: nasty vulgar-minded cat!\n\nHE [going to her] Oh don't, don't think of people in that way. Don't\nthink of her at all. [He takes her hand and sits down on the carpet at\nher feet]. Aurora: do you remember the evening when I sat here at your\nfeet and read you those poems for the first time?\n\nSHE. I shouldn't have let you: I see that now. When I think of Georgina\nsitting there at Teddy's feet and reading them to him for the first\ntime, I feel I shall just go distracted.\n\nHE. Yes, you are right. It will be a profanation.\n\nSHE. Oh, I don't care about the profanation; but what will Teddy think?\nwhat will he do? [Suddenly throwing his head away from her knee]. You\ndon't seem to think a bit about Teddy. [She jumps up, more and more\nagitated].\n\nHE [supine on the floor; for she has thrown him off his balance] To me\nTeddy is nothing, and Georgina less than nothing.\n\nSHE. You'll soon find out how much less than nothing she is. If you\nthink a woman can't do any harm because she's only a scandalmongering\ndowdy ragbag, you're greatly mistaken. [She flounces about the room. He\ngets up slowly and dusts his hands. Suddenly she runs to him and throws\nherself into his arms]. Henry: help me. Find a way out of this for me;\nand I'll bless you as long as you live. Oh, how wretched I am! [She sobs\non his breast].\n\nHE. And oh! how happy I am!\n\nSHE [whisking herself abruptly away] Don't be selfish.\n\nHE [humbly] Yes: I deserve that. I think if I were going to the stake\nwith you, I should still be so happy with you that I could hardly feel\nyour danger more than my own.\n\nSHE [relenting and patting his hand fondly] Oh, you are a dear darling\nboy, Henry; but [throwing his hand away fretfully] you're no use. I want\nsomebody to tell me what to do.\n\nHE [with quiet conviction] Your heart will tell you at the right time. I\nhave thought deeply over this; and I know what we two must do, sooner or\nlater.\n\nSHE. No, Henry. I will do nothing improper, nothing dishonorable. [She\nsits down plump on the stool and looks inflexible].\n\nHE. If you did, you would no longer be Aurora. Our course is perfectly\nsimple, perfectly straightforward, perfectly stainless and true. We love\none another. I am not ashamed of that: I am ready to go out and proclaim\nit to all London as simply as I will declare it to your husband when you\nsee--as you soon will see--that this is the only way honorable enough\nfor your feet to tread. Let us go out together to our own house,\nthis evening, without concealment and without shame. Remember! we owe\nsomething to your husband. We are his guests here: he is an honorable\nman: he has been kind to us: he has perhaps loved you as well as his\nprosaic nature and his sordid commercial environment permitted. We owe\nit to him in all honor not to let him learn the truth from the lips of\na scandalmonger. Let us go to him now quietly, hand in hand; bid him\nfarewell; and walk out of the house without concealment and subterfuge,\nfreely and honestly, in full honor and self-respect.\n\nSHE [staring at him] And where shall we go to?\n\nHE. We shall not depart by a hair's breadth from the ordinary natural\ncurrent of our lives. We were going to the theatre when the loss of the\npoems compelled us to take action at once. We shall go to the theatre\nstill; but we shall leave your diamonds here; for we cannot afford\ndiamonds, and do not need them.\n\nSHE [fretfully] I have told you already that I hate diamonds; only Teddy\ninsists on hanging me all over with them. You need not preach simplicity\nto me.\n\nHE. I never thought of doing so, dearest: I know that these trivialities\nare nothing to you. What was I saying--oh yes. Instead of coming\nback here from the theatre, you will come with me to my home--now and\nhenceforth our home--and in due course of time, when you are divorced,\nwe shall go through whatever idle legal ceremony you may desire. I\nattach no importance to the law: my love was not created in me by the\nlaw, nor can it be bound or loosed by it. That is simple enough, and\nsweet enough, is it not? [He takes the flower from the table]. Here are\nflowers for you: I have the tickets: we will ask your husband to lend\nus the carriage to show that there is no malice, no grudge, between us.\nCome!\n\nSHE [spiritlessly, taking the flowers without looking at them, and\ntemporizing] Teddy isn't in yet.\n\nHE. Well, let us take that calmly. Let us go to the theatre as if\nnothing had happened, and tell him when we come back. Now or three hours\nhence: to-day or to-morrow: what does it matter, provided all is done in\nhonor, without shame or fear?\n\nSHE. What did you get tickets for? Lohengrin?\n\nHE. I tried; but Lohengrin was sold out for to-night. [He takes out two\nCourt Theatre tickets].\n\nSHE. Then what did you get?\n\nHE. Can you ask me? What is there besides Lohengrin that we two could\nendure, except Candida?\n\nSHE [springing up] Candida! No, I won't go to it again, Henry [tossing\nthe flower on the piano]. It is that play that has done all the\nmischief. I'm very sorry I ever saw it: it ought to be stopped.\n\nHE [amazed] Aurora!\n\nSHE. Yes: I mean it.\n\nHE. That divinest love poem! the poem that gave us courage to speak to\none another! that revealed to us what we really felt for one another!\nThat--\n\nSHE. Just so. It put a lot of stuff into my head that I should never\nhave dreamt of for myself. I imagined myself just like Candida.\n\nHE [catching her hands and looking earnestly at her] You were right. You\nare like Candida.\n\nSHE [snatching her hands away] Oh, stuff! And I thought you were just\nlike Eugene. [Looking critically at him] Now that I come to look at you,\nyou are rather like him, too. [She throws herself discontentedly into\nthe nearest seat, which happens to be the bench at the piano. He goes to\nher].\n\nHE [very earnestly] Aurora: if Candida had loved Eugene she would have\ngone out into the night with him without a moment's hesitation.\n\nSHE [with equal earnestness] Henry: do you know what's wanting in that\nplay?\n\nHE. There is nothing wanting in it.\n\nSHE. Yes there is. There's a Georgina wanting in it. If Georgina had\nbeen there to make trouble, that play would have been a true-to-life\ntragedy. Now I'll tell you something about it that I have never told you\nbefore.\n\nHE. What is that?\n\nSHE. I took Teddy to it. I thought it would do him good; and so it would\nif I could only have kept him awake. Georgina came too; and you should\nhave heard the way she went on about it. She said it was downright\nimmoral, and that she knew the sort of woman that encourages boys to sit\non the hearthrug and make love to her. She was just preparing Teddy's\nmind to poison it about me.\n\nHE. Let us be just to Georgina, dearest\n\nSHE. Let her deserve it first. Just to Georgina, indeed!\n\nHE. She really sees the world in that way. That is her punishment.\n\nSHE. How can it be her punishment when she likes it? It'll be my\npunishment when she brings that budget of poems to Teddy. I wish you'd\nhave some sense, and sympathize with my position a little.\n\nHE. [going away from the piano and beginning to walk about rather\ntestily] My dear: I really don't care about Georgina or about Teddy. All\nthese squabbles belong to a plane on which I am, as you say, no use. I\nhave counted the cost; and I do not fear the consequences. After all,\nwhat is there to fear? Where is the difficulty? What can Georgina do?\nWhat can your husband do? What can anybody do?\n\nSHE. Do you mean to say that you propose that we should walk right bang\nup to Teddy and tell him we're going away together?\n\nHE. Yes. What can be simpler?\n\nSHE. And do you think for a moment he'd stand it, like that half-baked\nclergyman in the play? He'd just kill you.\n\nHE [coming to a sudden stop and speaking with considerable confidence]\nYou don't understand these things, my darling, how could you? In one\nrespect I am unlike the poet in the play. I have followed the Greek\nideal and not neglected the culture of my body. Your husband would make\na tolerable second-rate heavy weight if he were in training and ten\nyears younger. As it is, he could, if strung up to a great effort by\na burst of passion, give a good account of himself for perhaps fifteen\nseconds. But I am active enough to keep out of his reach for fifteen\nseconds; and after that I should be simply all over him.\n\nSHE [rising and coming to him in consternation] What do you mean by all\nover him?\n\nHE [gently] Don't ask me, dearest. At all events, I swear to you that\nyou need not be anxious about me.\n\nSHE. And what about Teddy? Do you mean to tell me that you are going to\nbeat Teddy before my face like a brutal prizefighter?\n\nHE. All this alarm is needless, dearest. Believe me, nothing will\nhappen. Your husband knows that I am capable of defending myself. Under\nsuch circumstances nothing ever does happen. And of course I shall do\nnothing. The man who once loved you is sacred to me.\n\nSHE [suspiciously] Doesn't he love me still? Has he told you anything?\n\nHE. No, no. [He takes her tenderly in his arms]. Dearest, dearest: how\nagitated you are! how unlike yourself! All these worries belong to\nthe lower plane. Come up with me to the higher one. The heights, the\nsolitudes, the soul world!\n\nSHE [avoiding his gaze] No: stop: it's no use, Mr Apjohn.\n\nHE [recoiling] Mr Apjohn!!!\n\nSHE. Excuse me: I meant Henry, of course.\n\nHE. How could you even think of me as Mr Apjohn? I never think of you as\nMrs Bompas: it is always Cand-- I mean Aurora, Aurora, Auro--\n\nSHE. Yes, yes: that's all very well, Mr Apjohn [He is about to interrupt\nagain: but she won't have it] no: it's no use: I've suddenly begun to\nthink of you as Mr Apjohn; and it's ridiculous to go on calling you\nHenry. I thought you were only a boy, a child, a dreamer. I thought you\nwould be too much afraid to do anything. And now you want to beat Teddy\nand to break up my home and disgrace me and make a horrible scandal in\nthe papers. It's cruel, unmanly, cowardly.\n\nHE [with grave wonder] Are you afraid?\n\nSHE. Oh, of course I'm afraid. So would you be if you had any common\nsense. [She goes to the hearth, turning her back to him, and puts one\ntapping foot on the fender].\n\nHE [watching her with great gravity] Perfect love casteth out fear. That\nis why I am not afraid. Mrs Bompas: you do not love me.\n\nSHE [turning to him with a gasp of relief] Oh, thank you, thank you! You\nreally can be very nice, Henry.\n\nHE. Why do you thank me?\n\nSHE [coming prettily to him from the fireplace] For calling me Mrs\nBompas again. I feel now that you are going to be reasonable and behave\nlike a gentleman. [He drops on the stool; covers his face with his hand;\nand groans]. What's the matter?\n\nHE. Once or twice in my life I have dreamed that I was exquisitely happy\nand blessed. But oh! the misgiving at the first stir of consciousness!\nthe stab of reality! the prison walls of the bedroom! the bitter, bitter\ndisappointment of waking! And this time! oh, this time I thought I was\nawake.\n\nSHE. Listen to me, Henry: we really haven't time for all that sort of\nflapdoodle now. [He starts to his feet as if she had pulled a trigger\nand straightened him by the release of a powerful spring, and goes past\nher with set teeth to the little table]. Oh, take care: you nearly hit\nme in the chin with the top of your head.\n\nHE [with fierce politeness] I beg your pardon. What is it you want me to\ndo? I am at your service. I am ready to behave like a gentleman if you\nwill be kind enough to explain exactly how.\n\nSHE [a little frightened] Thank you, Henry: I was sure you would. You're\nnot angry with me, are you?\n\nHE. Go on. Go on quickly. Give me something to think about, or I will--I\nwill--[he suddenly snatches up her fan and it about to break it in his\nclenched fists].\n\nSHE [running forward and catching at the fan, with loud lamentation]\nDon't break my fan--no, don't. [He slowly relaxes his grip of it as she\ndraws it anxiously out of his hands]. No, really, that's a stupid trick.\nI don't like that. You've no right to do that. [She opens the fan,\nand finds that the sticks are disconnected]. Oh, how could you be so\ninconsiderate?\n\nHE. I beg your pardon. I will buy you a new one.\n\nSHE [querulously] You will never be able to match it. And it was a\nparticular favorite of mine.\n\nHE [shortly] Then you will have to do without it: that's all.\n\nSHE. That's not a very nice thing to say after breaking my pet fan, I\nthink.\n\nHE. If you knew how near I was to breaking Teddy's pet wife and\npresenting him with the pieces, you would be thankful that you are alive\ninstead of--of--of howling about five shillings worth of ivory. Damn\nyour fan!\n\nSHE. Oh! Don't you dare swear in my presence. One would think you were\nmy husband.\n\nHE [again collapsing on the stool] This is some horrible dream. What has\nbecome of you? You are not my Aurora.\n\nSHE. Oh, well, if you come to that, what has become of you? Do you think\nI would ever have encouraged you if I had known you were such a little\ndevil?\n\nHE. Don't drag me down--don't--don't. Help me to find the way back to\nthe heights.\n\nSHE [kneeling beside him and pleading] If you would only be reasonable,\nHenry. If you would only remember that I am on the brink of ruin, and\nnot go on calmly saying it's all quite simple.\n\nHE. It seems so to me.\n\nSHE [jumping up distractedly] If you say that again I shall do something\nI'll be sorry for. Here we are, standing on the edge of a frightful\nprecipice. No doubt it's quite simple to go over and have done with it.\nBut can't you suggest anything more agreeable?\n\nHE. I can suggest nothing now. A chill black darkness has fallen: I can\nsee nothing but the ruins of our dream. [He rises with a deep sigh].\n\nSHE. Can't you? Well, I can. I can see Georgina rubbing those poems into\nTeddy. [Facing him determinedly] And I tell you, Henry Apjohn, that you\ngot me into this mess; and you must get me out of it again.\n\nHE [polite and hopeless] All I can say is that I am entirely at your\nservice. What do you wish me to do?\n\nSHE. Do you know anybody else named Aurora?\n\nHE. No.\n\nSHE. There's no use in saying No in that frozen pigheaded way. You must\nknow some Aurora or other somewhere.\n\nHE. You said you were the only Aurora in the world. And [lifting his\nclasped fists with a sudden return of his emotion] oh God! you were\nthe only Aurora in the world to me. [He turns away from her, hiding his\nface].\n\nSHE [petting him] Yes, yes, dear: of course. It's very nice of you; and\nI appreciate it: indeed I do; but it's not reasonable just at present.\nNow just listen to me. I suppose you know all those poems by heart.\n\nHE. Yes, by heart. [Raising his head and looking at her, with a sudden\nsuspicion] Don't you?\n\nSHE. Well, I never can remember verses; and besides, I've been so busy\nthat I've not had time to read them all; though I intend to the very\nfirst moment I can get: I promise you that most faithfully, Henry. But\nnow try and remember very particularly. Does the name of Bompas occur in\nany of the poems?\n\nHE [indignantly] No.\n\nSHE. You're quite sure?\n\nHE. Of course I am quite sure. How could I use such a name in a poem?\n\nSHE. Well, I don't see why not. It rhymes to rumpus, which seems\nappropriate enough at present, goodness knows! However, you're a poet,\nand you ought to know.\n\nHE. What does it matter--now?\n\nSHE. It matters a lot, I can tell you. If there's nothing about Bompas\nin the poems, we can say that they were written to some other Aurora,\nand that you showed them to me because my name was Aurora too. So you've\ngot to invent another Aurora for the occasion.\n\nHE [very coldly] Oh, if you wish me to tell a lie--\n\nSHE. Surely, as a man of honor--as a gentleman, you wouldn't tell the\ntruth, would you?\n\nHE. Very well. You have broken my spirit and desecrated my dreams.\nI will lie and protest and stand on my honor: oh, I will play the\ngentleman, never fear.\n\nSHE. Yes, put it all on me, of course. Don't be mean, Henry.\n\nHE [rousing himself with an effort] You are quite right, Mrs Bompas: I\nbeg your pardon. You must excuse my temper. I have got growing pains, I\nthink.\n\nSHE. Growing pains!\n\nHE. The process of growing from romantic boyhood into cynical maturity\nusually takes fifteen years. When it is compressed into fifteen minutes,\nthe pace is too fast; and growing pains are the result.\n\nSHE. Oh, is this a time for cleverness? It's settled, isn't it, that\nyou're going to be nice and good, and that you'll brazen it out to Teddy\nthat you have some other Aurora?\n\nHE. Yes: I'm capable of anything now. I should not have told him the\ntruth by halves; and now I will not lie by halves. I'll wallow in the\nhonor of a gentleman.\n\nSHE. Dearest boy, I knew you would. I--Sh! [she rushes to the door, and\nholds it ajar, listening breathlessly].\n\nHE. What is it?\n\nSHE [white with apprehension] It's Teddy: I hear him tapping the new\nbarometer. He can't have anything serious on his mind or he wouldn't\ndo that. Perhaps Georgina hasn't said anything. [She steals back to the\nhearth]. Try and look as if there was nothing the matter. Give me my\ngloves, quick. [He hands them to her. She pulls on one hastily and\nbegins buttoning it with ostentatious unconcern]. Go further away from\nme, quick. [He walks doggedly away from her until the piano prevents his\ngoing farther]. If I button my glove, and you were to hum a tune, don't\nyou think that--\n\nHE. The tableau would be complete in its guiltiness. For Heaven's sake,\nMrs Bompas, let that glove alone: you look like a pickpocket.\n\nHer husband comes in: a robust, thicknecked, well groomed city man,\nwith a strong chin but a blithering eye and credulous mouth. He has a\nmomentous air, but shows no sign of displeasure: rather the contrary.\n\nHER HUSBAND. Hallo! I thought you two were at the theatre.\n\nSHE. I felt anxious about you, Teddy. Why didn't you come home to\ndinner?\n\nHER HUSBAND. I got a message from Georgina. She wanted me to go to her.\n\nSHE. Poor dear Georgina! I'm sorry I haven't been able to call on her\nthis last week. I hope there's nothing the matter with her.\n\nHER HUSBAND. Nothing, except anxiety for my welfare and yours. [She\nsteals a terrified look at Henry]. By, the way, Apjohn, I should like a\nword with you this evening, if Aurora can spare you for a moment.\n\nHE [formally] I am at your service.\n\nHER HUSBAND. No hurry. After the theatre will do.\n\nHE. We have decided not to go.\n\nHER HUSBAND. Indeed! Well, then, shall we adjourn to my snuggery?\n\nSHE. You needn't move. I shall go and lock up my diamonds since I'm not\ngoing to the theatre. Give me my things.\n\nHER HUSBAND [as he hands her the cloud and the mirror] Well, we shall\nhave more room here.\n\nHE [looking about him and shaking his shoulders loose] I think I should\nprefer plenty of room.\n\nHER HUSBAND. So, if it's not disturbing you, Rory--?\n\nSHE. Not at all. [She goes out].\n\nWhen the two men are alone together, Bompas deliberately takes the poems\nfrom his breast pocket; looks at them reflectively; then looks at Henry,\nmutely inviting his attention. Henry refuses to understand, doing his\nbest to look unconcerned.\n\nHER HUSBAND. Do these manuscripts seem at all familiar to you, may I\nask?\n\nHE. Manuscripts?\n\nHER HUSBAND. Yes. Would you like to look at them a little closer? [He\nproffers them under Henry's nose].\n\nHE [as with a sudden illumination of glad surprise] Why, these are my\npoems.\n\nHER HUSBAND. So I gather.\n\nHE. What a shame! Mrs Bompas has shown them to you! You must think me an\nutter ass. I wrote them years ago after reading Swinburne's Songs Before\nSunrise. Nothing would do me then but I must reel off a set of Songs\nto the Sunrise. Aurora, you know: the rosy fingered Aurora. They're all\nabout Aurora. When Mrs Bompas told me her name was Aurora, I couldn't\nresist the temptation to lend them to her to read. But I didn't bargain\nfor your unsympathetic eyes.\n\nHER HUSBAND [grinning] Apjohn: that's really very ready of you. You are\ncut out for literature; and the day will come when Rory and I will be\nproud to have you about the house. I have heard far thinner stories from\nmuch older men.\n\nHE [with an air of great surprise] Do you mean to imply that you don't\nbelieve me?\n\nHER HUSBAND. Do you expect me to believe you?\n\nHE. Why not? I don't understand.\n\nHER HUSBAND. Come! Don't underrate your own cleverness, Apjohn. I think\nyou understand pretty well.\n\nHE. I assure you I am quite at a loss. Can you not be a little more\nexplicit?\n\nHER HUSBAND. Don't overdo it, old chap. However, I will just be so far\nexplicit as to say that if you think these poems read as if they were\naddressed, not to a live woman, but to a shivering cold time of day at\nwhich you were never out of bed in your life, you hardly do justice to\nyour own literary powers--which I admire and appreciate, mind you, as\nmuch as any man. Come! own up. You wrote those poems to my wife. [An\ninternal struggle prevents Henry from answering]. Of course you did.\n[He throws the poems on the table; and goes to the hearthrug, where\nhe plants himself solidly, chuckling a little and waiting for the next\nmove].\n\nHE [formally and carefully] Mr Bompas: I pledge you my word you are\nmistaken. I need not tell you that Mrs Bompas is a lady of stainless\nhonor, who has never cast an unworthy thought on me. The fact that she\nhas shown you my poems--\n\nHER HUSBAND. That's not a fact. I came by them without her knowledge.\nShe didn't show them to me.\n\nHE. Does not that prove their perfect innocence? She would have shown\nthem to you at once if she had taken your quite unfounded view of them.\n\nHER HUSBAND [shaken] Apjohn: play fair. Don't abuse your intellectual\ngifts. Do you really mean that I am making a fool of myself?\n\nHE [earnestly] Believe me, you are. I assure you, on my honor as a\ngentleman, that I have never had the slightest feeling for Mrs Bompas\nbeyond the ordinary esteem and regard of a pleasant acquaintance.\n\nHER HUSBAND [shortly, showing ill humor for the first time] Oh, indeed.\n[He leaves his hearth and begins to approach Henry slowly, looking him\nup and down with growing resentment].\n\nHE [hastening to improve the impression made by his mendacity] I should\nnever have dreamt of writing poems to her. The thing is absurd.\n\nHER HUSBAND [reddening ominously] Why is it absurd?\n\nHE [shrugging his shoulders] Well, it happens that I do not admire Mrs\nBompas--in that way.\n\nHER HUSBAND [breaking out in Henry's face] Let me tell you that Mrs\nBompas has been admired by better men than you, you soapy headed little\npuppy, you.\n\nHE [much taken aback] There is no need to insult me like this. I assure\nyou, on my honor as a--\n\nHER HUSBAND [too angry to tolerate a reply, and boring Henry more and\nmore towards the piano] You don't admire Mrs Bompas! You would never\ndream of writing poems to Mrs Bompas! My wife's not good enough for you,\nisn't she. [Fiercely] Who are you, pray, that you should be so jolly\nsuperior?\n\nHE. Mr Bompas: I can make allowances for your jealousy--\n\nHER HUSBAND. Jealousy! do you suppose I'm jealous of YOU? No, nor of ten\nlike you. But if you think I'll stand here and let you insult my wife in\nher own house, you're mistaken.\n\nHE [very uncomfortable with his back against the piano and Teddy\nstanding over him threateningly] How can I convince you? Be reasonable.\nI tell you my relations with Mrs Bompas are relations of perfect\ncoldness--of indifference--\n\nHER HUSBAND [scornfully] Say it again: say it again. You're proud of it,\naren't you? Yah! You're not worth kicking.\n\nHenry suddenly executes the feat known to pugilists as dipping, and\nchanges sides with Teddy, who it now between Henry and the piano.\n\nHE. Look here: I'm not going to stand this.\n\nHER HUSBAND. Oh, you have some blood in your body after all! Good job!\n\nHE. This is ridiculous. I assure you Mrs. Bompas is quite--\n\nHER HUSBAND. What is Mrs Bompas to you, I'd like to know. I'll tell\nyou what Mrs Bompas is. She's the smartest woman in the smartest set in\nSouth Kensington, and the handsomest, and the cleverest, and the most\nfetching to experienced men who know a good thing when they see it,\nwhatever she may be to conceited penny-a-lining puppies who think\nnothing good enough for them. It's admitted by the best people; and not\nto know it argues yourself unknown. Three of our first actor-managers\nhave offered her a hundred a week if she'd go on the stage when they\nstart a repertory theatre; and I think they know what they're about as\nwell as you. The only member of the present Cabinet that you might call\na handsome man has neglected the business of the country to dance with\nher, though he don't belong to our set as a regular thing. One of the\nfirst professional poets in Bedford Park wrote a sonnet to her, worth\nall your amateur trash. At Ascot last season the eldest son of a duke\nexcused himself from calling on me on the ground that his feelings for\nMrs Bompas were not consistent with his duty to me as host; and it did\nhim honor and me too. But [with gathering fury] she isn't good enough\nfor you, it seems. You regard her with coldness, with indifference;\nand you have the cool cheek to tell me so to my face. For two pins I'd\nflatten your nose in to teach you manners. Introducing a fine woman to\nyou is casting pearls before swine [yelling at him] before SWINE! d'ye\nhear?\n\nHE [with a deplorable lack of polish] You call me a swine again and I'll\nland you one on the chin that'll make your head sing for a week.\n\nHER HUSBAND [exploding] What--!\n\nHe charges at Henry with bull-like fury. Henry places himself on\nguard in the manner of a well taught boxer, and gets away smartly,\nbut unfortunately forgets the stool which is just behind him. He falls\nbackwards over it, unintentionally pushing it against the shins of\nBompas, who falls forward over it. Mrs Bompas, with a scream, rushes\ninto the room between the sprawling champions, and sits down on the\nfloor in order to get her right arm round her husband's neck.\n\nSHE. You shan't, Teddy: you shan't. You will be killed: he is a\nprizefighter.\n\nHER HUSBAND [vengefully] I'll prizefight him. [He struggles vainly to\nfree himself from her embrace].\n\nSHE. Henry: don't let him fight you. Promise me that you won't.\n\nHE [ruefully] I have got a most frightful bump on the back of my head.\n[He tries to rise].\n\nSHE [reaching out her left hand to seize his coat tail, and pulling him\ndown again, whilst keeping fast hold of Teddy with the other hand] Not\nuntil you have promised: not until you both have promised. [Teddy tries\nto rise: she pulls him back again]. Teddy: you promise, don't you? Yes,\nyes. Be good: you promise.\n\nHER HUSBAND. I won't, unless he takes it back.\n\nSHE. He will: he does. You take it back, Henry?--yes.\n\nHE [savagely] Yes. I take it back. [She lets go his coat. He gets up. So\ndoes Teddy]. I take it all back, all, without reserve.\n\nSHE [on the carpet] Is nobody going to help me up? [They each take a\nhand and pull her up]. Now won't you shake hands and be good?\n\nHE [recklessly] I shall do nothing of the sort. I have steeped myself in\nlies for your sake; and the only reward I get is a lump on the back of\nmy head the size of an apple. Now I will go back to the straight path.\n\nSHE. Henry: for Heaven's sake--\n\nHE. It's no use. Your husband is a fool and a brute--\n\nHER HUSBAND. What's that you say?\n\nHE. I say you are a fool and a brute; and if you'll step outside with me\nI'll say it again. [Teddy begins to take off his coat for combat]. Those\npoems were written to your wife, every word of them, and to nobody else.\n[The scowl clears away from Bompas's countenance. Radiant, he replaces\nhis coat]. I wrote them because I loved her. I thought her the most\nbeautiful woman in the world; and I told her so over and over again. I\nadored her: do you hear? I told her that you were a sordid commercial\nchump, utterly unworthy of her; and so you are.\n\nHER HUSBAND [so gratified, he can hardly believe his ears] You don't\nmean it!\n\nHE. Yes, I do mean it, and a lot more too. I asked Mrs Bompas to walk\nout of the house with me--to leave you--to get divorced from you and\nmarry me. I begged and implored her to do it this very night. It was her\nrefusal that ended everything between us. [Looking very disparagingly at\nhim] What she can see in you, goodness only knows!\n\nHER HUSBAND [beaming with remorse] My dear chap, why didn't you say\nso before? I apologize. Come! Don't bear malice: shake hands. Make him\nshake hands, Rory.\n\nSHE. For my sake, Henry. After all, he's my husband. Forgive him.\nTake his hand. [Henry, dazed, lets her take his hand and place it in\nTeddy's].\n\nHER HUSBAND [shaking it heartily] You've got to own that none of your\nliterary heroines can touch my Rory. [He turns to her and claps her with\nfond pride on the shoulder]. Eh, Rory? They can't resist you: none of\nem. Never knew a man yet that could hold out three days.\n\nSHE. Don't be foolish, Teddy. I hope you were not really hurt, Henry.\n[She feels the back of his head. He flinches]. Oh, poor boy, what a\nbump! I must get some vinegar and brown paper. [She goes to the bell and\nrings].\n\nHER HUSBAND. Will you do me a great favor, Apjohn. I hardly like to ask;\nbut it would be a real kindness to us both.\n\nHE. What can I do?\n\nHER HUSBAND [taking up the poems] Well, may I get these printed? It\nshall be done in the best style. The finest paper, sumptuous binding,\neverything first class. They're beautiful poems. I should like to show\nthem about a bit.\n\nSHE [running back from the bell, delighted with the idea, and coming\nbetween them] Oh Henry, if you wouldn't mind!\n\nHE. Oh, I don't mind. I am past minding anything. I have grown too fast\nthis evening.\n\nSHE. How old are you, Henry?\n\nHE. This morning I was eighteen. Now I am--confound it! I'm quoting\nthat beast of a play [he takes the Candida tickets out of his pocket and\ntears them up viciously].\n\nHER HUSBAND. What shall we call the volume? To Aurora, or something like\nthat, eh?\n\nHE. I should call it How He Lied to Her Husband.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's How He Lied to Her Husband, by George Bernard Shaw"}

Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard suspects a prank by three medical students whom Miss Cushing was forced to evict because of their unruly behaviour. The parcel was sent from Belfast, the city of origin of one of the former boarders. Upon examining the parcel himself, Holmes is convinced that it is evidence of a serious crime. He reasons that a medical student with access to a dissection laboratory would likely use something other than plain salt to preserve human remains, and would be able to make a more precise cut than the roughly hacked ears suggest. The address on the package, roughly written and with a spelling correction, suggests to Holmes that the sender lacks education and is unfamiliar with Croydon. The knot in the string suggests to Holmes that they are looking for someone with sailing experience.\nHolmes considers the solution so simple that he asks Lestrade not to mention his name in connection with it. A few simple questions to Miss Cushing, a few observations, a cable to Liverpool, and a visit to Miss Cushing's sister Sarah (Holmes was denied admittance by the doctor because she was having a \"brain fever\") convince Holmes that the ears belong to Miss Cushing's other sister, Mary, and her extramarital lover, and that they have been murdered. He is convinced that Mary's estranged husband, Jim Browner, is the murderer, and that Browner had sent the cardboard box containing the ears to the Cushings' house in Croydon (addressing it merely to \"S. Cushing\"), not realizing that Sarah was no longer resident there. Browner, who is an unpleasant man when drunk, had meant to horrify Sarah (rather than Susan) because he ultimately blamed Sarah for causing the trouble that culminated in his murder of his wife and her lover.\nBrowner is indeed a sailor, and Belfast was the first port where he had the chance to post the parcel. Lestrade, acting on Holmes's information, is waiting to arrest him when his ship reaches London. He confesses everything. He is presented with considerable sympathy, a simple man so tormented by guilt at his act that he would welcome being hanged. The real villain of the story â morally if not legally â is Sarah Cushing, who fell in love and tried to seduce Browner herself; then, when he rejected her advances, set out to wreck his marriage with her sister Mary, by poisoning her mind to her own husband and by introducing and pushing her onto a new lover, which she easily took to, especially given her husband's propensity for getting drunk (and being rather rough when so intoxicated). In the end, her husband's inability to accept her betrayal, and sheer jealousy at discovering the affair, causes him to commit what Sherlock considers a \"crime of passion\".", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by David Brannan.  HTML version by Al Haines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Cardboard Box\n\n\nBy\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n\n\n\nIn choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental\nqualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have endeavoured, as far as\npossible, to select those which presented the minimum of\nsensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents.  It is,\nhowever, unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational\nfrom the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must\neither sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so\ngive a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which\nchance, and not choice, has provided him with.  With this short preface\nI shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a\npeculiarly terrible, chain of events.\n\nIt was a blazing hot day in August.  Baker Street was like an oven, and\nthe glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across\nthe road was painful to the eye.  It was hard to believe that these\nwere the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of\nwinter.  Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the\nsofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the\nmorning post.  For myself, my term of service in India had trained me\nto stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no\nhardship.  But the morning paper was uninteresting.  Parliament had\nrisen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the\nNew Forest or the shingle of Southsea.  A depleted bank account had\ncaused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the\ncountry nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him.  He\nloved to lie in the very center of five millions of people, with his\nfilaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every\nlittle rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime.  Appreciation of nature\nfound no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he\nturned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his\nbrother of the country.\n\nFinding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed aside\nthe barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell into a brown\nstudy.  Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts:\n\n\"You are right, Watson,\" said he.  \"It does seem a most preposterous\nway of settling a dispute.\"\n\n\"Most preposterous!\" I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he\nhad echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and\nstared at him in blank amazement.\n\n\"What is this, Holmes?\" I cried.  \"This is beyond anything which I\ncould have imagined.\"\n\nHe laughed heartily at my perplexity.\n\n\"You remember,\" said he, \"that some little time ago when I read you the\npassage in one of Poe's sketches in which a close reasoner follows the\nunspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the\nmatter as a mere tour-de-force of the author.  On my remarking that I\nwas constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed\nincredulity.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your\neyebrows.  So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a\ntrain of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading\nit off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been\nin rapport with you.\"\n\nBut I was still far from satisfied.  \"In the example which you read to\nme,\" said I, \"the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the\nman whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of\nstones, looked up at the stars, and so on.  But I have been seated\nquietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?\"\n\n\"You do yourself an injustice.  The features are given to man as the\nmeans by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful\nservants.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my\nfeatures?\"\n\n\"Your features and especially your eyes.  Perhaps you cannot yourself\nrecall how your reverie commenced?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you.  After throwing down your paper, which was the\naction which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a\nvacant expression.  Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly\nframed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your\nface that a train of thought had been started.  But it did not lead\nvery far.  Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry\nWard Beecher which stands upon the top of your books.  Then you glanced\nup at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious.  You were\nthinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare\nspace and correspond with Gordon's picture there.\"\n\n\"You have followed me wonderfully!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"So far I could hardly have gone astray.  But now your thoughts went\nback to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the\ncharacter in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you\ncontinued to look across, and your face was thoughtful.  You were\nrecalling the incidents of Beecher's career.  I was well aware that you\ncould not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on\nbehalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your\nexpressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was\nreceived by the more turbulent of our people.  You felt so strongly\nabout it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of\nthat also.  When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the\npicture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War,\nand when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your\nhands clenched I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the\ngallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But\nthen, again, your face grew sadder, you shook your head.  You were\ndwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life.  Your\nhand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your\nlips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of\nsettling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. At\nthis point I agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to\nfind that all my deductions had been correct.\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\" said I.  \"And now that you have explained it, I confess\nthat I am as amazed as before.\"\n\n\"It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you.  I should not\nhave intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity\nthe other day.  But I have in my hands here a little problem which may\nprove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought\nreading.  Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to\nthe remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to Miss\nCushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?\"\n\n\"No, I saw nothing.\"\n\n\"Ah! then you must have overlooked it.  Just toss it over to me. Here\nit is, under the financial column.  Perhaps you would be good enough to\nread it aloud.\"\n\nI picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the\nparagraph indicated. It was headed, \"A Gruesome Packet.\"\n\n\"Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the\nvictim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical\njoke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to\nthe incident.  At two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet,\nwrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman.  A cardboard box\nwas inside, which was filled with coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss\nCushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly\nsevered.  The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the\nmorning before.  There is no indication as to the sender, and the\nmatter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of\nfifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or\ncorrespondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything\nthrough the post.  Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge,\nshe let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom\nshe was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular\nhabits.  The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been\nperpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge\nand who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the\ndissecting-rooms.  Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact\nthat one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the\nbest of Miss Cushing's belief, from Belfast.  In the meantime, the\nmatter is being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very\nsmartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.\"\n\n\"So much for the Daily Chronicle,\" said Holmes as I finished reading.\n\"Now for our friend Lestrade.  I had a note from him this morning, in\nwhich he says:\n\n\"I think that this case is very much in your line.  We have every hope\nof clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting\nanything to work upon.  We have, of course, wired to the Belfast\npost-office, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that\nday, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of\nremembering the sender.  The box is a half-pound box of honeydew\ntobacco and does not help us in any way.  The medical student theory\nstill appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a\nfew hours to spare I should be very happy to see you out here.  I shall\nbe either at the house or in the police-station all day.\n\n\"What say you, Watson?  Can you rise superior to the heat and run down\nto Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?\"\n\n\"I was longing for something to do.\"\n\n\"You shall have it then.  Ring for our boots and tell them to order a\ncab.  I'll be back in a moment when I have changed my dressing-gown and\nfilled my cigar-case.\"\n\nA shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far\nless oppressive in Croydon than in town.  Holmes had sent on a wire, so\nthat Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever, was\nwaiting for us at the station.  A walk of five minutes took us to Cross\nStreet, where Miss Cushing resided.\n\nIt was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim,\nwith whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned women gossiping\nat the doors.  Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and tapped at a door,\nwhich was opened by a small servant girl.  Miss Cushing was sitting in\nthe front room, into which we were ushered.  She was a placid-faced\nwoman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her\ntemples on each side.  A worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a\nbasket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her.\n\n\"They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,\" said she as Lestrade\nentered.  \"I wish that you would take them away altogether.\"\n\n\"So I shall, Miss Cushing.  I only kept them here until my friend, Mr.\nHolmes, should have seen them in your presence.\"\n\n\"Why in my presence, sir?\"\n\n\"In case he wished to ask any questions.\"\n\n\"What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know nothing\nwhatever about it?\"\n\n\"Quite so, madam,\" said Holmes in his soothing way.  \"I have no doubt\nthat you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business.\"\n\n\"Indeed I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life. It is\nsomething new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the\npolice in my house.  I won't have those things in here, Mr. Lestrade.\nIf you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse.\"\n\nIt was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house.\nLestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece\nof brown paper and some string.  There was a bench at the end of the\npath, and we all sat down while Homes examined one by one, the articles\nwhich Lestrade had handed to him.\n\n\"The string is exceedingly interesting,\" he remarked, holding it up to\nthe light and sniffing at it.  \"What do you make of this string,\nLestrade?\"\n\n\"It has been tarred.\"\n\n\"Precisely.  It is a piece of tarred twine.  You have also, no doubt,\nremarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be\nseen by the double fray on each side.  This is of importance.\"\n\n\"I cannot see the importance,\" said Lestrade.\n\n\"The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and that\nthis knot is of a peculiar character.\"\n\n\"It is very neatly tied.  I had already made a note of that effect,\"\nsaid Lestrade complacently.\n\n\"So much for the string, then,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"now for the box\nwrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. What, did you\nnot observe it?  I think there can be no doubt of it.  Address printed\nin rather straggling characters:  'Miss S. Cushing, Cross Street,\nCroydon.'  Done with a broad-pointed pen, probably a J, and with very\ninferior ink.  The word 'Croydon' has been originally spelled with an\n'i', which has been changed to 'y'.  The parcel was directed, then, by\na man--the printing is distinctly masculine--of limited education and\nunacquainted with the town of Croydon.  So far, so good!  The box is a\nyellow, half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two\nthumb marks at the left bottom corner.  It is filled with rough salt of\nthe quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser\ncommercial purposes.  And embedded in it are these very singular\nenclosures.\"\n\nHe took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his\nknee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward\non each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and\nat the thoughtful, eager face of our companion.  Finally he returned\nthem to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation.\n\n\"You have observed, of course,\" said he at last, \"that the ears are not\na pair.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have noticed that.  But if this were the practical joke of some\nstudents from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to\nsend two odd ears as a pair.\"\n\n\"Precisely.  But this is not a practical joke.\"\n\n\"You are sure of it?\"\n\n\"The presumption is strongly against it.  Bodies in the\ndissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid.  These ears bear\nno signs of this.  They are fresh, too.  They have been cut off with a\nblunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it.\nAgain, carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which\nwould suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt.\nI repeat that there is no practical joke here, but that we are\ninvestigating a serious crime.\"\n\nA vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion's words and\nsaw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. This brutal\npreliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror\nin the background. Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is\nonly half convinced.\n\n\"There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,\" said he, \"but\nthere are much stronger reasons against the other.  We know that this\nwoman has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for\nthe last twenty years.  She has hardly been away from her home for a\nday during that time.  Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her\nthe proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate\nactress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?\"\n\n\"That is the problem which we have to solve,\" Holmes answered, \"and for\nmy part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct,\nand that a double murder has been committed.  One of these ears is a\nwoman's, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring.  The other\nis a man's, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring.\nThese two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their\nstory before now.  To-day is Friday.  The packet was posted on Thursday\nmorning.  The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday, or\nearlier.  If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would\nhave sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing?  We may take it that\nthe sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he must have some\nstrong reason for sending Miss Cushing this packet.  What reason then?\nIt must have been to tell her that the deed was done! or to pain her,\nperhaps.  But in that case she knows who it is.  Does she know?  I\ndoubt it.  If she knew, why should she call the police in?  She might\nhave buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. That is\nwhat she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal.  But\nif she does not wish to shield him she would give his name.  There is a\ntangle here which needs straightening out.\"  He had been talking in a\nhigh, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now he\nsprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.\n\n\"I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,\" said he.\n\n\"In that case I may leave you here,\" said Lestrade, \"for I have another\nsmall business on hand.  I think that I have nothing further to learn\nfrom Miss Cushing.  You will find me at the police-station.\"\n\n\"We shall look in on our way to the train,\" answered Holmes.  A moment\nlater he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady\nwas still quietly working away at her antimacassar.  She put it down on\nher lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching blue\neyes.\n\n\"I am convinced, sir,\" she said, \"that this matter is a mistake, and\nthat the parcel was never meant for me at all.  I have said this\nseveral times to the gentlemen from Scotland Yard, but he simply laughs\nat me.  I have not an enemy in the world, as far as I know, so why\nshould anyone play me such a trick?\"\n\n\"I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,\" said Holmes,\ntaking a seat beside her.  \"I think that it is more than probable--\" He\npaused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was\nstaring with singular intentness at the lady's profile.  Surprise and\nsatisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face,\nthough when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he\nhad become as demure as ever.  I stared hard myself at her flat,\ngrizzled hair, her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid\nfeatures; but I could see nothing which could account for my\ncompanion's evident excitement.\n\n\"There were one or two questions--\"\n\n\"Oh, I am weary of questions!\" cried Miss Cushing impatiently.\n\n\"You have two sisters, I believe.\"\n\n\"How could you know that?\"\n\n\"I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a\nportrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one of whom is\nundoubtedly yourself, while the others are so exceedingly like you that\nthere could be no doubt of the relationship.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are quite right.  Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.\"\n\n\"And here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at Liverpool, of your\nyounger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by\nhis uniform.  I observe that she was unmarried at the time.\"\n\n\"You are very quick at observing.\"\n\n\"That is my trade.\"\n\n\"Well, you are quite right.  But she was married to Mr. Browner a few\ndays afterwards.  He was on the South American line when that was\ntaken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn't abide to leave her\nfor so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London boats.\"\n\n\"Ah, the Conqueror, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No, the May Day, when last I heard.  Jim came down here to see me\nonce.  That was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he would\nalways take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink would send him\nstark, staring mad.  Ah! it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in\nhis hand again.  First he dropped me, then he quarrelled with Sarah,\nand now that Mary has stopped writing we don't know how things are\ngoing with them.\"\n\nIt was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which she\nfelt very deeply.  Like most people who lead a lonely life, she was shy\nat first, but ended by becoming extremely communicative.  She told us\nmany details about her brother-in-law the steward, and then wandering\noff on the subject of her former lodgers, the medical students, she\ngave us a long account of their delinquencies, with their names and\nthose of their hospitals.  Holmes listened attentively to everything,\nthrowing in a question from time to time.\n\n\"About your second sister, Sarah,\" said he.  \"I wonder, since you are\nboth maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.\"\n\n\"Ah! you don't know Sarah's temper or you would wonder no more. I tried\nit when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two months ago,\nwhen we had to part.  I don't want to say a word against my own sister,\nbut she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah.\"\n\n\"You say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.\"\n\n\"Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time.  Why, she went up\nthere to live in order to be near them.  And now she has no word hard\nenough for Jim Browner.  The last six months that she was here she\nwould speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways.  He had caught\nher meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that was\nthe start of it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Cushing,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing.  \"Your\nsister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington?\nGood-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a\ncase with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do.\"\n\nThere was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.\n\n\"How far to Wallington?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only about a mile, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good.  Jump in, Watson.  We must strike while the iron is hot.\nSimple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive\ndetails in connection with it.  Just pull up at a telegraph office as\nyou pass, cabby.\"\n\nHolmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in\nthe cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his\nface. Our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which\nwe had just quitted.  My companion ordered him to wait, and had his\nhand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young gentleman\nin black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step.\n\n\"Is Miss Cushing at home?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,\" said he.  \"She has been\nsuffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. As her\nmedical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing\nanyone to see her.  I should recommend you to call again in ten days.\"\nHe drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched off down the street.\n\n\"Well, if we can't we can't,\" said Holmes, cheerfully.\n\n\"Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.\"\n\n\"I did not wish her to tell me anything.  I only wanted to look at her.\nHowever, I think that I have got all that I want.  Drive us to some\ndecent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and afterwards we\nshall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the police-station.\"\n\nWe had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would talk\nabout nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how he had\npurchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five hundred\nguineas, at a Jew broker's in Tottenham Court Road for fifty-five\nshillings.  This led him to Paganini, and we sat for an hour over a\nbottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that\nextraordinary man.  The afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare\nhad softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the\npolice-station.  Lestrade was waiting for us at the door.\n\n\"A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.\n\n\"Ha!  It is the answer!\"  He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it,\nand crumpled it into his pocket.  \"That's all right,\" said he.\n\n\"Have you found out anything?\"\n\n\"I have found out everything!\"\n\n\"What!\" Lestrade stared at him in amazement.  \"You are joking.\"\n\n\"I was never more serious in my life.  A shocking crime has been\ncommitted, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.\"\n\n\"And the criminal?\"\n\nHolmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards\nand threw it over to Lestrade.\n\n\"That is the name,\" he said.  \"You cannot effect an arrest until\nto-morrow night at the earliest.  I should prefer that you do not\nmention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be\nonly associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in\ntheir solution.  Come on, Watson.\"  We strode off together to the\nstation, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the\ncard which Holmes had thrown him.\n\n\n\"The case,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars that\nnight in our rooms at Baker Street, \"is one where, as in the\ninvestigations which you have chronicled under the names of 'A Study in\nScarlet' and of 'The Sign of Four,' we have been compelled to reason\nbackward from effects to causes.  I have written to Lestrade asking him\nto supply us with the details which are now wanting, and which he will\nonly get after he had secured his man.  That he may be safely trusted\nto do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as\ntenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and\nindeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at\nScotland Yard.\"\n\n\"Your case is not complete, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is fairly complete in essentials.  We know who the author of the\nrevolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us.\nOf course, you have formed your own conclusions.\"\n\n\"I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool boat, is\nthe man whom you suspect?\"\n\n\"Oh! it is more than a suspicion.\"\n\n\"And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear.  Let me run\nover the principal steps.  We approached the case, you remember, with\nan absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage.  We had formed\nno theories.  We were simply there to observe and to draw inferences\nfrom our observations.  What did we see first?  A very placid and\nrespectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a\nportrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters.  It\ninstantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for\none of these.  I set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or\nconfirmed at our leisure.  Then we went to the garden, as you remember,\nand we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box.\n\n\"The string was of the quality which is used by sail-makers aboard\nship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our\ninvestigation.  When I observed that the knot was one which is popular\nwith sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the\nmale ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among\nsailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that all the actors in the\ntragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes.\n\n\"When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it\nwas to Miss S. Cushing.  Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be\nMiss Cushing, and although her initial was 'S' it might belong to one\nof the others as well.  In that case we should have to commence our\ninvestigation from a fresh basis altogether.  I therefore went into the\nhouse with the intention of clearing up this point.  I was about to\nassure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been made\nwhen you may remember that I came suddenly to a stop.  The fact was\nthat I had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the\nsame time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.\n\n\"As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the\nbody which varies so much as the human ear.  Each ear is as a rule\nquite distinctive and differs from all other ones.  In last year's\nAnthropological Journal you will find two short monographs from my pen\nupon the subject.  I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with\nthe eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical\npeculiarities.  Imagine my surprise, then, when on looking at Miss\nCushing I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female\near which I had just inspected.  The matter was entirely beyond\ncoincidence.  There was the same shortening of the pinna, the same\nbroad curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner\ncartilage.  In all essentials it was the same ear.\n\n\"In the first place, her sister's name was Sarah, and her address had\nuntil recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the\nmistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard\nof this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had\nat one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone\nup to Liverpool to be near the Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards\ndivided them.  This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for\nsome months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to\nMiss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.\n\n\"And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully.  We\nhad learned of the existence of this steward, an impulsive man, of\nstrong passions--you remember that he threw up what must have been a\nvery superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife--subject, too, to\noccasional fits of hard drinking. We had reason to believe that his\nwife had been murdered, and that a man--presumably a seafaring man--had\nbeen murdered at the same time.  Jealousy, of course, at once suggests\nitself as the motive for the crime.  And why should these proofs of the\ndeed be sent to Miss Sarah Cushing?  Probably because during her\nresidence in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events\nwhich led to the tragedy.  You will observe that this line of boats\ncall at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that Browner\nhad committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer, the\nMay Day, Belfast would be the first place at which he could post his\nterrible packet.\n\n\"A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and although I\nthought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to elucidate it\nbefore going further.  An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and\nMrs. Browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband.\nThere were many grave objections to this theory, but it was\nconceivable.  I therefore sent off a telegram to my friend Algar, of\nthe Liverpool force, and asked him to find out if Mrs. Browner were at\nhome, and if Browner had departed in the May Day.  Then we went on to\nWallington to visit Miss Sarah.\n\n\"I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had\nbeen reproduced in her.  Then, of course, she might give us very\nimportant information, but I was not sanguine that she would.  She must\nhave heard of the business the day before, since all Croydon was\nringing with it, and she alone could have understood for whom the\npacket was meant.  If she had been willing to help justice she would\nprobably have communicated with the police already.  However, it was\nclearly our duty to see her, so we went.  We found that the news of the\narrival of the packet--for her illness dated from that time--had such\nan effect upon her as to bring on brain fever.  It was clearer than\never that she understood its full significance, but equally clear that\nwe should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.\n\n\"However, we were really independent of her help.  Our answers were\nwaiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed Algar to\nsend them.  Nothing could be more conclusive.  Mrs. Browner's house had\nbeen closed for more than three days, and the neighbours were of\nopinion that she had gone south to see her relatives.  It had been\nascertained at the shipping offices that Browner had left aboard of the\nMay Day, and I calculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow night.\nWhen he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and\nI have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations.  Two days\nlater he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from\nthe detective, and a typewritten document, which covered several pages\nof foolscap.\n\n\"Lestrade has got him all right,\" said Holmes, glancing up at me.\n\"Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Holmes:\n\nIn accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our\ntheories\" [\"the 'we' is rather fine, Watson, is it not?\"] \"I went down\nto the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 p.m., and boarded the S.S. May Day,\nbelonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet Company.\nOn inquiry, I found that there was a steward on board of the name of\nJames Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an\nextraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him\nof his duties.  On descending to his berth, I found him seated upon a\nchest with his head sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro.\nHe is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy--something\nlike Aldrige, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair.  He jumped up\nwhen he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a\ncouple of river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to\nhave no heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the\ndarbies.  We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well, for\nwe thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp\nknife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble.\nHowever, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being\nbrought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a\nstatement, which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our\nshorthand man.  We had three copies typewritten, one of which I\nenclose.  The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be an\nextremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me in my\ninvestigation.  With kind regards,\n\n\"Yours very truly,\n  \"G. Lestrade.\n\n\n\"Hum!  The investigation really was a very simple one,\" remarked\nHolmes, \"but I don't think it struck him in that light when he first\ncalled us in.  However, let us see what Jim Browner has to say for\nhimself.  This is his statement as made before Inspector Montgomery at\nthe Shadwell Police Station, and it has the advantage of being\nverbatim.\"\n\n\n\"'Have I anything to say?  Yes, I have a deal to say.  I have to make a\nclean breast of it all.  You can hang me, or you can leave me alone.  I\ndon't care a plug which you do.  I tell you I've not shut an eye in\nsleep since I did it, and I don't believe I ever will again until I get\npast all waking.  Sometimes it's his face, but most generally it's\nhers.  I'm never without one or the other before me.  He looks frowning\nand black-like, but she has a kind o' surprise upon her face.  Ay, the\nwhite lamb, she might well be surprised when she read death on a face\nthat had seldom looked anything but love upon her before.\n\n\"'But it was Sarah's fault, and may the curse of a broken man put a\nblight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins!  It's not that I\nwant to clear myself.  I know that I went back to drink, like the beast\nthat I was.  But she would have forgiven me; she would have stuck as\nclose to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our\ndoor.  For Sarah Cushing loved me--that's the root of the business--she\nloved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that\nI thought more of my wife's footmark in the mud than I did of her whole\nbody and soul.\n\n\"'There were three sisters altogether.  The old one was just a good\nwoman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah was\nthirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We were just as\nhappy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all\nLiverpool there was no better woman than my Mary.  And then we asked\nSarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one thing led\nto another, until she was just one of ourselves.\n\n\"'I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little money\nby, and all was as bright as a new dollar.  My God, whoever would have\nthought that it could have come to this?  Whoever would have dreamed it?\n\n\"'I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if the\nship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at a time, and\nin this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah. She was a fine\ntall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a proud way of carrying\nher head, and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint. But when\nlittle Mary was there I had never a thought of her, and that I swear as\nI hope for God's mercy.\n\n\"'It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me, or\nto coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never thought anything of\nthat.  But one evening my eyes were opened. I had come up from the ship\nand found my wife out, but Sarah at home.  \"Where's Mary?\" I asked.\n\"Oh, she has gone to pay some accounts.\"  I was impatient and paced up\nand down the room. \"Can't you be happy for five minutes without Mary,\nJim?\" says she.  \"It's a bad compliment to me that you can't be\ncontented with my society for so short a time.\"  \"That's all right, my\nlass,\" said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she\nhad it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a\nfever.  I looked into her eyes and I read it all there.  There was no\nneed for her to speak, nor for me either.  I frowned and drew my hand\naway.  Then she stood by my side in silence for a bit, and then put up\nher hand and patted me on the shoulder.  \"Steady old Jim!\" said she,\nand with a kind o' mocking laugh, she ran out of the room.\n\n\"'Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul,\nand she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let her go on\nbiding with us--a besotted fool--but I never said a word to Mary, for I\nknew it would grieve her.  Things went on much as before, but after a\ntime I began to find that there was a bit of a change in Mary herself.\nShe had always been so trusting and so innocent, but now she became\nqueer and suspicious, wanting to know where I had been and what I had\nbeen doing, and whom my letters were from, and what I had in my\npockets, and a thousand such follies.  Day by day she grew queerer and\nmore irritable, and we had ceaseless rows about nothing.  I was fairly\npuzzled by it all.  Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just\ninseparable.  I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and\npoisoning my wife's mind against me, but I was such a blind beetle that\nI could not understand it at the time.  Then I broke my blue ribbon and\nbegan to drink again, but I think I should not have done it if Mary had\nbeen the same as ever. She had some reason to be disgusted with me now,\nand the gap between us began to be wider and wider.  And then this Alec\nFairbairn chipped in, and things became a thousand times blacker.\n\n\"'It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it was\nto see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made friends\nwherever he went.  He was a dashing, swaggering chap, smart and curled,\nwho had seen half the world and could talk of what he had seen.  He was\ngood company, I won't deny it, and he had wonderful polite ways with\nhim for a sailor man, so that I think there must have been a time when\nhe knew more of the poop than the forecastle.  For a month he was in\nand out of my house, and never once did it cross my mind that harm\nmight come of his soft, tricky ways.  And then at last something made\nme suspect, and from that day my peace was gone forever.\n\n\"'It was only a little thing, too.  I had come into the parlour\nunexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on\nmy wife's face.  But as she saw who it was it faded again, and she\nturned away with a look of disappointment.  That was enough for me.\nThere was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken\nfor mine.  If I could have seen him then I should have killed him, for\nI have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose.  Mary saw\nthe devil's light in my eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my\nsleeve. \"Don't, Jim, don't!\" says she.  \"Where's Sarah?\" I asked.  \"In\nthe kitchen,\" says she.  \"Sarah,\" says I as I went in, \"this man\nFairbairn is never to darken my door again.\"  \"Why not?\" says she.\n\"Because I order it.\"  \"Oh!\" says she, \"if my friends are not good\nenough for this house, then I am not good enough for it either.\"  \"You\ncan do what you like,\" says I, \"but if Fairbairn shows his face here\nagain I'll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.\"  She was\nfrightened by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the\nsame evening she left my house.\n\n\"'Well, I don't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of\nthis woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me against my\nwife by encouraging her to misbehave.  Anyway, she took a house just\ntwo streets off and let lodgings to sailors. Fairbairn used to stay\nthere, and Mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him.\nHow often she went I don't know, but I followed her one day, and as I\nbroke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall, like\nthe cowardly skunk that he was.  I swore to my wife that I would kill\nher if I found her in his company again, and I led her back with me,\nsobbing and trembling, and as white as a piece of paper.  There was no\ntrace of love between us any longer.  I could see that she hated me and\nfeared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she\ndespised me as well.\n\n\"'Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool, so\nshe went back, as I understand, to live with her sister in Croydon, and\nthings jogged on much the same as ever at home.  And then came this\nweek and all the misery and ruin.\n\n\"'It was in this way.  We had gone on the May Day for a round voyage of\nseven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates, so\nthat we had to put back into port for twelve hours.  I left the ship\nand came home, thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife, and\nhoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon.  The thought was\nin my head as I turned into my own street, and at that moment a cab\npassed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two\nchatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching\nthem from the footpath.\n\n\"'I tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that moment I\nwas not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when I look back\non it.  I had been drinking hard of late, and the two things together\nfairly turned my brain.  There's something throbbing in my head now,\nlike a docker's hammer, but that morning I seemed to have all Niagara\nwhizzing and buzzing in my ears.\n\n\"'Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab.  I had a heavy oak\nstick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the first; but as I ran\nI got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see them without being\nseen.  They pulled up soon at the railway station.  There was a good\ncrowd round the booking-office, so I got quite close to them without\nbeing seen.  They took tickets for New Brighton.  So did I, but I got\nin three carriages behind them.  When we reached it they walked along\nthe Parade, and I was never more than a hundred yards from them.  At\nlast I saw them hire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot\nday, and they thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.\n\n\"'It was just as if they had been given into my hands.  There was a bit\nof a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred yards.  I\nhired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them.  I could see the blur\nof their craft, but they were going nearly as fast as I, and they must\nhave been a long mile from the shore before I caught them up.  The haze\nwas like a curtain all round us, and there were we three in the middle\nof it.  My God, shall I ever forget their faces when they saw who was\nin the boat that was closing in upon them?  She screamed out.  He swore\nlike a madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death\nin my eyes.  I got past it and got one in with my stick that crushed\nhis head like an egg.  I would have spared her, perhaps, for all my\nmadness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out to him, and\ncalling him \"Alec.\"  I struck again, and she lay stretched beside him.\nI was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood.  If Sarah had been\nthere, by the Lord, she should have joined them.  I pulled out my\nknife, and--well, there! I've said enough.  It gave me a kind of savage\njoy when I thought how Sarah would feel when she had such signs as\nthese of what her meddling had brought about.  Then I tied the bodies\ninto the boat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk.  I knew\nvery well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings\nin the haze, and had drifted off out to sea.  I cleaned myself up, got\nback to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of\nwhat had passed.  That night I made up the packet for Sarah Cushing,\nand next day I sent it from Belfast.\n\n\"'There you have the whole truth of it.  You can hang me, or do what\nyou like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been punished\nalready.  I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at\nme--staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze.\nI killed them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if I have\nanother night of it I shall be either mad or dead before morning.  You\nwon't put me alone into a cell, sir?  For pity's sake don't, and may\nyou be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.'\n\n\n\"What is the meaning of it, Watson?\" said Holmes solemnly as he laid\ndown the paper.  \"What object is served by this circle of misery and\nviolence and fear?  It must tend to some end, or else our universe is\nruled by chance, which is unthinkable.  But what end?  There is the\ngreat standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from\nan answer as ever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventure of the Cardboard Box, by\nArthur Conan Doyle"}

Looking for work, he finds the local cedar mill was closed down three years prior by its heir, Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough), who opened a new casino that now accounts for the majority of revenue for the local area. Hamilton, who was also Vaughn's school friend, invites him to a night of fun at the casino. While checking out the VIP lounge, Vaughn stumbles upon his childhood friend Deni (Ashley Scott), who is now working as a stripper. Later, he notices the craps dealer using loaded dice and demonstrates this to the patrons by placing a bet and calling out the roll before throwing the dice. When the floorman declares no payout, Vaughn instigates a fight. Although he beats down most of the security guards, he is subsequently subdued with a cattle prod and knocked unconscious. The security staff take Vaughn into the basement and Hamilton's right-hand man and head of security Booth (Kevin Durand) tortures him by cutting his torso with a utility knife before dumping him on a roadside. He is found by a trucker and hospitalized, but recovers quickly.\nVaughn goes to the sheriff, Stan Watkins (Michael Bowen), to press charges against the guards, but Sheriff Watkins refuses to allow him to do so because the casino is viewed as too important to the town's economy, stating that because of its position, the casino is considered a \"no fly zone\". After this, Vaughn also learns that his nephew, Pete (Khleo Thomas), experimented with crystal meth, which was sold to his friends by the casino security guards. Infuriated, Vaughn goes to the casino, and using a piece of lumber as a club, begins destroying casino property, and brutally beats the security guards when they attempt to stop him. Vaughn is apprehended by Sheriff Watkins and his deputies as he is driving away from the scene.\nIn the ensuing trial, all of Hamilton's security and staff testify against Vaughn. When the judge allows Vaughn to present his defense, he fires his appointed attorney, who is implicitly under Hamilton's employ. After making a civic speech about the town's great former self, Vaughn tells the jury and the rest of the town that if he's cleared of the charges, he will run for sheriff and clean up the town. To further emphasize his plea, Vaughn reveals the grotesque scars on his torso from his being tortured by the casino staff. He is then acquitted and wins the election for sheriff. Upon taking office, he summarily dismisses the entire police force and deputizes his friend, Ray Templeton (Johnny Knoxville), whom Vaughn feels he can trust, as well as help Vaughn learn about narcotics (Templeton revealed earlier that he served time in prison after becoming a drug addict).\nVaughn and Templeton find drugs on Booth and they take him into custody. In an attempt to make him reveal information on the town drug operation, they hold him captive in a garage and proceed to strip his truck into pieces in front of him, but he does not talk. Vaughn assigns Templeton to stand watch over his house, as he knows Hamilton will likely target his family. Vaughn himself remains at the sheriff's office to supervise Booth. He is visited by Deni, stopping by under the pretense of bringing him food and reveals that she quit her job as the casino stripper. The two end up spending the night together in the office. The next morning, Watkins and his deputies arrive at the Sheriff's office where they blow up Vaughn's truck and fire upon the building with machine guns. Recognizing his dangerous predicament, Booth pleads for Vaughn to let him out of his cell, prompting Vaughn to use Booth's perilous situation as leverage for information. Booth reveals that the old mill is where the drugs are being produced, but is immediately killed by the indiscriminate fire of the attackers. Vaughn manages to kill all of the attackers with Deni's help.\nVaughn's parents' house is attacked, but Templeton and Vaughn's father are able to dispatch the gunmen. After ensuring their safety, Vaughn heads for the mill where he discovers a meth lab as well as Hamilton, calmly waiting in a control room. Hamilton attempts to kill Vaughn with the mill equipment by dropping him through a trap door, but Vaughn drags Hamilton down with him and the two fall through a chute. Vaughn, whose leg is injured, manages to tend to his injury in a nearby forest before Hamilton attacks him with an axe. The two fight for their lives, with Vaughn ultimately coming out on top by beating Hamilton with a nearby uprooted tree, breaking his leg. Vaughn repeats what Hamilton said to him earlier \"You're right, Jay. This does change our relationship. This is my town. You're under arrest.\" And Hamilton is arrested and taken into custody, with Templeton's assistance, Vaughn shuts down the casino. In the closing scene it is revealed that the local mill is back in use.", "normalized_text": "WALKING TALL\n\n                                          Written by \n\n                                  Mort Briskin & David Klass\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRO\n\nInspired by a true story.\n\nWe home in on a boat coming in to shore.

{"doc_id": "a50e0b16f4c85587a6c89476c2f9f3ced9f4480c", "token_count": 11632, "summary": " After crossing the sea guided by the Bellman's map of the Oceanâa blank sheet of paperâthe hunting party arrive in a strange land, and the Bellman informs them of the five signs of a Snark: its \"meagre and hollow, but crisp\" taste; a habit of rising late and taking breakfast during five o'clock tea; \"its slowness in taking a jest\"; a \"fondness for bathing-machines\"; and its ambition. The Bellman warns them that some Snarks are highly dangerous Boojums, causing the Baker to faint. Once revived, the Baker recalls that his uncle warned him that if the Snark turns out to be a Boojum, the hunter will \"softly and suddenly vanish away, and never be met with again.\" The Baker confesses that the notion of this sudden vanishment brings him much distress.\nWith this in mind, they split up to hunt the Snark: \"They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; / They pursued it with forks and hope; / They threatened its life with a railway-share; / They charmed it with smiles and soap.\" Along the way, the Butcher and Beaver, previously mutually wary, become fast friends, after the Butcher teaches it more in ten minutes than it could learn from books in seventy years. The Barrister, meanwhile, dreams of the court trial of a pig accused of deserting its sty, whom the Snark is defending. The Snark, however, finds the pig guilty and sentences it to transportation and a fine of forty pound. His dream concludes with the jailer informing the court that the pig has actually been dead for years, to the judge's disgust.\nDuring the hunt, the Banker finds himself attacked by a bandersnatch, and loses his sanity after trying to bribe the creature. At the conclusion of the poem, the Baker calls out that he has found a snark, but when the others arrive, he has mysteriously disappeared, leading the narrator to explain: \"For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.\"", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK ***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK\n\n                          Lewis Carroll\n\n               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 1.2\n\n\n\n\n                    THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK\n                     an Agony in Eight Fits\n                               by\n                          Lewis Carroll\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nIf--and the thing is wildly possible--the charge of writing nonsense\nwere ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive\npoem, it would be based, I feel convinced, on the line (in p.4)\n\n          \"Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes.\"\n\nIn view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal\nindignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of\nsuch a deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose\nof this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously\ninculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History--I will\ntake the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened.\n\nThe Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used\nto have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished,\nand it more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it,\nthat no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged\nto. They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman\nabout it--he would only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in\npathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been\nable to understand--so it generally ended in its being fastened on,\nanyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman used to stand by with tears in\nhis eyes; he knew it was all wrong, but alas!  Rule 42 of the Code, \"No\none shall speak to the Man at the Helm,\" had been completed by the\nBellman himself with the words \"and the Man at the Helm shall speak to\nno one.\"  So remonstrance was impossible, and no steering could be done\ntill the next varnishing day.  During these bewildering intervals the\nship usually sailed backwards.\n\nAs this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock,\nlet me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been\nasked me, how to pronounce \"slithy toves.\"  The \"i\" in \"slithy\" is long,\nas in \"writhe\"; and \"toves\" is pronounced so as to rhyme with \"groves.\"\nAgain, the first \"o\" in \"borogoves\" is pronounced like the \"o\" in\n\"borrow.\"  I have heard people try to give it the sound of the \"o\" in\n\"worry\".  Such is Human Perversity.\n\nThis also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in\nthat poem.  Humpty-Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word\nlike a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all.\n\nFor instance, take the two words \"fuming\" and \"furious.\"  Make up your\nmind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will\nfirst.  Now open your mouth and speak.  If your thoughts incline\never so little towards \"fuming,\" you will say \"fuming-furious;\" if they\nturn, by even a hair's breadth, towards \"furious,\" you will say\n\"furious-fuming;\" but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly\nbalanced mind, you will say \"frumious.\"\n\nSupposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words--\n\n          \"Under which king, Bezonian?  Speak or die!\"\n\nJustice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard,\nbut had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say\neither name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die,\nhe would have gasped out \"Rilchiam!\"\n\n\n\n                 Fit the First\n\n                  THE LANDING\n\n\n     \"Just the place for a Snark!\" the Bellman cried,\n          As he landed his crew with care;\n     Supporting each man on the top of the tide\n          By a finger entwined in his hair.\n\n     \"Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it twice:\n          That alone should encourage the crew.\n     Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it thrice:\n          What I tell you three times is true.\"\n\n     The crew was complete: it included a Boots--\n          A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--\n     A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--\n          And a Broker, to value their goods.\n\n     A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,\n          Might perhaps have won more than his share--\n     But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,\n          Had the whole of their cash in his care.\n\n     There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,\n          Or would sit making lace in the bow:\n     And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,\n          Though none of the sailors knew how.\n\n     There was one who was famed for the number of things\n          He forgot when he entered the ship:\n     His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,\n          And the clothes he had bought for the trip.\n\n     He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,\n          With his name painted clearly on each:\n     But, since he omitted to mention the fact,\n          They were all left behind on the beach.\n\n     The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because\n          He had seven coats on when he came,\n     With three pairs of boots--but the worst of it was,\n          He had wholly forgotten his name.\n\n     He would answer to \"Hi!\" or to any loud cry,\n          Such as \"Fry me!\" or \"Fritter my wig!\"\n     To \"What-you-may-call-um!\" or \"What-was-his-name!\"\n          But especially \"Thing-um-a-jig!\"\n\n     While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,\n          He had different names from these:\n     His intimate friends called him \"Candle-ends,\"\n          And his enemies \"Toasted-cheese.\"\n\n     \"His form is ungainly--his intellect small--\"\n          (So the Bellman would often remark)\n     \"But his courage is perfect!  And that, after all,\n          Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.\"\n\n     He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare\n          With an impudent wag of the head:\n     And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,\n          \"Just to keep up its spirits,\" he said.\n\n     He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--\n          And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--\n     He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,\n          No materials were to be had.\n\n     The last of the crew needs especial remark,\n          Though he looked an incredible dunce:\n     He had just one idea--but, that one being \"Snark,\"\n          The good Bellman engaged him at once.\n\n     He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,\n          When the ship had been sailing a week,\n     He could only kill Beavers.  The Bellman looked scared,\n          And was almost too frightened to speak:\n\n     But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,\n          There was only one Beaver on board;\n     And that was a tame one he had of his own,\n          Whose death would be deeply deplored.\n\n     The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,\n          Protested, with tears in its eyes,\n     That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark\n          Could atone for that dismal surprise!\n\n     It strongly advised that the Butcher should be\n          Conveyed in a separate ship:\n     But the Bellman declared that would never agree\n          With the plans he had made for the trip:\n\n     Navigation was always a difficult art,\n          Though with only one ship and one bell:\n     And he feared he must really decline, for his part,\n          Undertaking another as well.\n\n     The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure\n          A second-hand dagger-proof coat--\n     So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure\n          Its life in some Office of note:\n\n     This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire\n          (On moderate terms), or for sale,\n     Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,\n          And one Against Damage From Hail.\n\n     Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,\n          Whenever the Butcher was by,\n     The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,\n          And appeared unaccountably shy.\n\n\n\n                      Fit the Second\n\n                   THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH\n\n\n     The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--\n          Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!\n     Such solemnity, too!  One could see he was wise,\n          The moment one looked in his face!\n\n     He had bought a large map representing the sea,\n          Without the least vestige of land:\n     And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be\n          A map they could all understand.\n\n     \"What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,\n          Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?\"\n     So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply\n          \"They are merely conventional signs!\n\n     \"Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!\n          But we've got our brave Captain to thank:\"\n     (So the crew would protest) \"that he's bought us the best--\n          A perfect and absolute blank!\"\n\n     This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out\n          That the Captain they trusted so well\n     Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,\n          And that was to tingle his bell.\n\n     He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave\n          Were enough to bewilder a crew.\n     When he cried \"Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!\"\n          What on earth was the helmsman to do?\n\n     Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:\n          A thing, as the Bellman remarked,\n     That frequently happens in tropical climes,\n          When a vessel is, so to speak, \"snarked.\"\n\n     But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,\n          And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,\n     Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,\n          That the ship would not travel due West!\n\n     But the danger was past--they had landed at last,\n          With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:\n     Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,\n          Which consisted of chasms and crags.\n\n     The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,\n          And repeated in musical tone\n     Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--\n          But the crew would do nothing but groan.\n\n     He served out some grog with a liberal hand,\n          And bade them sit down on the beach:\n     And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,\n          As he stood and delivered his speech.\n\n     \"Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!\"\n          (They were all of them fond of quotations:\n     So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,\n          While he served out additional rations).\n\n     \"We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,\n          (Four weeks to the month you may mark),\n     But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)\n          Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!\n\n     \"We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,\n          (Seven days to the week I allow),\n     But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,\n          We have never beheld till now!\n\n     \"Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again\n          The five unmistakable marks\n     By which you may know, wheresoever you go,\n          The warranted genuine Snarks.\n\n     \"Let us take them in order.  The first is the taste,\n          Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:\n     Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,\n          With a flavour of Will-o'-the-wisp.\n\n     \"Its habit of getting up late you'll agree\n          That it carries too far, when I say\n     That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,\n          And dines on the following day.\n\n     \"The third is its slowness in taking a jest.\n          Should you happen to venture on one,\n     It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:\n          And it always looks grave at a pun.\n\n     \"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,\n          Which is constantly carries about,\n     And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--\n          A sentiment open to doubt.\n\n     \"The fifth is ambition.  It next will be right\n          To describe each particular batch:\n     Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,\n          And those that have whiskers, and scratch.\n\n     \"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,\n          Yet, I feel it my duty to say,\n     Some are Boojums--\" The Bellman broke off in alarm,\n          For the Baker had fainted away.\n\n\n\n                      Fit the Third\n\n                     THE BAKER'S TALE\n\n\n     They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--\n          They roused him with mustard and cress--\n     They roused him with jam and judicious advice--\n          They set him conundrums to guess.\n\n     When at length he sat up and was able to speak,\n          His sad story he offered to tell;\n     And the Bellman cried \"Silence!  Not even a shriek!\"\n          And excitedly tingled his bell.\n\n     There was silence supreme!  Not a shriek, not a scream,\n          Scarcely even a howl or a groan,\n     As the man they called \"Ho!\" told his story of woe\n          In an antediluvian tone.\n\n     \"My father and mother were honest, though poor--\"\n          \"Skip all that!\" cried the Bellman in haste.\n     \"If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--\n          We have hardly a minute to waste!\"\n\n     \"I skip forty years,\" said the Baker, in tears,\n          \"And proceed without further remark\n     To the day when you took me aboard of your ship\n          To help you in hunting the Snark.\n\n     \"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)\n          Remarked, when I bade him farewell--\"\n     \"Oh, skip your dear uncle!\" the Bellman exclaimed,\n          As he angrily tingled his bell.\n\n     \"He remarked to me then,\" said that mildest of men,\n          \"'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:\n     Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,\n          And it's handy for striking a light.\n\n     \"'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;\n          You may hunt it with forks and hope;\n     You may threaten its life with a railway-share;\n          You may charm it with smiles and soap--'\"\n\n     (\"That's exactly the method,\" the Bellman bold\n          In a hasty parenthesis cried,\n     \"That's exactly the way I have always been told\n          That the capture of Snarks should be tried!\")\n\n     \"'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,\n          If your Snark be a Boojum!

words:\n     And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl\n          Brimming over with quivering curds!\n\n     \"It is this, it is this--\" \"We have had that before!\"\n          The Bellman

HUNTING\n\n\n     The Bellman looked huffish, and wrinkled his brow.\n          \"If only you'd spoken before!\n     It's excessively awkward to mention it now,\n          With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!\n\n     \"We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,\n          If you never were met with again--\n     But surely, my man, when the voyage began,\n          You might have suggested it then?\n\n     \"It's excessively awkward to mention it now--\n          As I think I've already remarked.\"\n     And the man they called \"Hi!\" replied, with a sigh,\n          \"I informed you the day we embarked.\n\n     \"You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--\n          (We are all of us weak at times):\n     But the slightest approach to a false pretence\n          Was never among my crimes!\n\n     \"I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--\n          I said it in German and Greek:\n     But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)\n          That English is what you speak!\"\n\n     \"'Tis a pitiful tale,\" said the Bellman, whose face\n          Had grown longer at every word:\n     \"But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,\n          More debate would be simply absurd.\n\n     \"The rest of my speech\" (he explained to his men)\n          \"You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.\n     But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!\n          'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!\n\n     \"To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;\n          To pursue it with forks and hope;\n     To threaten its life with a railway-share;\n          To charm it with smiles and soap!\n\n     \"For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't\n          Be caught in a commonplace way.\n     Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:\n          Not a chance must be wasted to-day!\n\n     \"For England expects--I forbear to proceed:\n          'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:\n     And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need\n          To rig yourselves out for the fight.\"\n\n     Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),\n          And changed his loose silver for notes.\n     The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,\n          And shook the dust out of his coats.\n\n     The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--\n          Each working the grindstone in turn:\n     But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed\n          No interest in the concern:\n\n     Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,\n          And vainly proceeded to cite\n     A number of cases, in which making laces\n          Had been proved an infringement of right.\n\n     The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned\n          A novel arrangement of bows:\n     While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand\n          Was chalking the tip of his nose.\n\n     But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,\n          With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--\n     Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,\n          Which the Bellman declared was all \"stuff.\"\n\n     \"Introduce me, now there's a good fellow,\" he said,\n          \"If we happen to meet it together!\"\n     And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,\n          Said \"That must depend on the weather.\"\n\n     The Beaver went simply galumphing about,\n          At seeing the Butcher so shy:\n     And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,\n          Made an effort to wink with one eye.\n\n     \"Be a man!\" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard\n          The Butcher beginning to sob.\n     \"Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,\n          We shall need all our strength for the job!\"\n\n\n\n                      Fit the Fifth\n\n                   THE BEAVER'S LESSON\n\n\n     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n          They pursued it with forks and hope;\n     They threatened its life with a railway-share;\n          They charmed it with smiles and soap.\n\n     Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan\n          For making a separate sally;\n     And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,\n          A dismal and desolate valley.\n\n     But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:\n          It had chosen the very same place:\n     Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,\n          The disgust that appeared in his face.\n\n     Each thought he was thinking of nothing but \"Snark\"\n          And the glorious work of the day;\n     And each tried to pretend that he did not remark\n          That the other was going that way.\n\n     But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,\n          And the evening got darker and colder,\n     Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)\n          They marched along shoulder to shoulder.\n\n     Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,\n          And they knew that some danger was near:\n     The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,\n          And even the Butcher felt queer.\n\n     He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--\n          That blissful and innocent state--\n     The sound so exactly recalled to his mind\n          A pencil that squeaks on a slate!\n\n     \"'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!\" he suddenly cried.\n          (This man, that they used to call \"Dunce.\")\n     \"As the Bellman would tell you,\" he added with pride,\n          \"I have uttered that sentiment once.\n\n     \"'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;\n          You will find I have told it you twice.\n     'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,\n          If only I've stated it thrice.\"\n\n     The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,\n          Attending to every word:\n     But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,\n          When the third repetition occurred.\n\n     It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,\n          It had somehow contrived to lose count,\n     And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains\n          By reckoning up the amount.\n\n     \"Two added to one--if that could but be done,\"\n          It said, \"with one's fingers and thumbs!\"\n     Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,\n          It had taken no pains with its sums.\n\n     \"The thing can be done,\" said the Butcher, \"I think.\n          The thing must be done, I am sure.\n     The thing shall be done!  Bring me paper and ink,\n          The best there is time to procure.\"\n\n     The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,\n          And ink in unfailing supplies:\n     While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,\n          And watched them with wondering eyes.\n\n     So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,\n          As he wrote with a pen in each hand,\n     And explained all the while in a popular style\n          Which the Beaver could well understand.\n\n     \"Taking Three as the subject to reason about--\n          A convenient number to state--\n     We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out\n          By One Thousand diminished by Eight.\n\n     \"The result we proceed to divide, as you see,\n          By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:\n     Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be\n          Exactly and perfectly true.\n\n     \"The method employed I would gladly explain,\n          While I have it so clear in my head,\n     If I had but the time and you had but the brain--\n          But much yet remains to be said.\n\n     \"In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been\n          Enveloped in absolute mystery,\n     And without extra charge I will give you at large\n          A Lesson in Natural History.\"\n\n     In his genial way he proceeded to say\n          (Forgetting all laws of propriety,\n     And that giving instruction, without introduction,\n          Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),\n\n     \"As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,\n          Since it lives in perpetual passion:\n     Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--\n          It is ages ahead of the fashion:\n\n     \"But it knows any friend it has met once before:\n          It never will look at a bribe:\n     And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,\n          And collects--though it does not subscribe.\n\n     \"Its' flavour when cooked is more exquisite far\n          Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:\n     (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,\n          And some, in mahogany kegs:)\n\n     \"You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:\n          You condense it with locusts and tape:\n     Still keeping one principal object in view--\n          To preserve its symmetrical shape.\"\n\n     The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,\n          But he felt that the lesson must end,\n     And he wept with delight in attempting to say\n          He considered the Beaver his friend.\n\n     While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks\n          More eloquent even than tears,\n     It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books\n          Would have taught it in seventy years.\n\n     They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned\n          (For a moment) with noble emotion,\n     Said \"This amply repays all the wearisome days\n          We have spent on the billowy ocean!\"\n\n     Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,\n          Have seldom if ever been known;\n     In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--\n          You could never meet either alone.\n\n     And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds\n          Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour--\n     The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,\n          And cemented their friendship for ever!\n\n\n\n                      Fit the Sixth\n\n                  THE BARRISTER'S DREAM\n\n\n     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n          They pursued it with forks and hope;\n     They threatened its life with a railway-share;\n          They charmed it with smiles and soap.\n\n     But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain\n          That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,\n     Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain\n          That his fancy had dwelt on so long.\n\n     He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,\n          Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,\n     Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig\n          On the charge of deserting its sty.\n\n     The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,\n          That the sty was deserted when found:\n     And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law\n          In a soft under-current of sound.\n\n     The indictment had never been clearly expressed,\n          And it seemed that the Snark had begun,\n     And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed\n          What the pig was supposed to have done.\n\n     The Jury had each formed a different view\n          (Long before the indictment was read),\n     And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew\n          One word that the others had said.\n\n     \"You must know--\" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed \"Fudge!\"\n          That statute is obsolete quite!\n     Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends\n          On an ancient manorial right.\n\n     \"In the matter of Treason the pig would appear\n          To have aided, but scarcely abetted:\n     While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,\n          If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'\n\n     \"The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;\n          But its guilt, as I trust, is removed\n     (So far as related to the costs of this suit)\n          By the Alibi which has been proved.\n\n     \"My poor client's fate now depends on your votes.\"\n          Here the speaker sat down in his place,\n     And directed the Judge to refer to his notes\n          And briefly to sum up the case.\n\n     But the Judge said he never had summed up before;\n          So the Snark undertook it instead,\n     And summed it so well that it came to far more\n          Than the Witnesses ever had said!\n\n     When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,\n          As the word was so puzzling to spell;\n     But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind\n          Undertaking that duty as well.\n\n     So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,\n          It was spent with the toils of the day:\n     When it said the word \"GUILTY!\" the Jury all groaned,\n          And some of them fainted away.\n\n     Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite\n          Too nervous to utter a word:\n     When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,\n          And the fall of a pin might be heard.\n\n     \"Transportation for life\" was the sentence it gave,\n          \"And _then_ to be fined forty pound.\"\n     The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared\n          That the phrase was not legally sound.\n\n     But their wild exultation was suddenly checked\n          When the jailer informed them, with tears,\n     Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,\n          As the pig had been dead for some years.\n\n     The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:\n          But the Snark, though a little aghast,\n     As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,\n          Went bellowing on to the last.\n\n     Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed\n          To grow every moment more clear:\n     Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,\n          Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.\n\n\n\n                     Fit the Seventh\n\n                    THE BANKER'S FATE\n\n\n     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n          They pursued it with forks and hope;\n     They threatened its life with a railway-share;\n          They charmed it with smiles and soap.\n\n     And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new\n          It was matter for general remark,\n     Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view\n          In his zeal to discover the Snark\n\n     But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,\n          A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh\n     And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,\n          For he knew it was useless to fly.\n\n     He offered large discount--he offered a cheque\n          (Drawn \"to bearer\") for seven-pounds-ten:\n     But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck\n          And grabbed at the Banker again.\n\n     Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws\n          Went savagely snapping around--\n     He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,\n          Till fainting he fell to the ground.\n\n     The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared\n          Led on by that fear-stricken yell:\n     And the Bellman remarked \"It is just as I feared!\"\n          And solemnly tolled on his bell.\n\n     He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace\n          The least likeness to what he had been:\n     While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white--\n          A wonderful thing to be seen!\n\n     To the horror of all who were present that day.\n          He uprose in full evening dress,\n     And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say\n          What his tongue could no longer express.\n\n     Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--\n          And chanted in mimsiest tones\n     Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,\n          While he rattled a couple of bones.\n\n     \"Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!\"\n          The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.\n     \"We have lost half the day.  Any further delay,\n          And we sha'nt catch a Snark before night!\"\n\n\n\n                      Fit the Eighth\n\n                      THE VANISHING\n\n\n     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n          They pursued it with forks and hope;\n     They threatened its life with a railway-share;\n          They charmed it with smiles and soap.\n\n     They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,\n          And the Beaver, excited at last,\n     Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,\n          For the daylight was nearly past.\n\n     \"There is Thingumbob shouting!\" the Bellman said,\n          \"He is shouting like mad, only hark!\n     He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,\n          He has certainly found a Snark!\"\n\n     They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed\n          \"He was always a desperate wag!\"\n     They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--\n          On the top of a neighboring crag.\n\n     Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.\n          In the next, that wild figure they saw\n     (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,\n          While they waited and listened in awe.\n\n     \"It's a Snark!\" was the sound that first came to their ears,\n          And seemed almost too good to be true.\n     Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:\n          Then the ominous words \"It's a Boo-\"\n\n     Then, silence.  Some fancied they heard in the air\n          A weary and wandering sigh\n     Then sounded like \"-jum!\" but the others declare\n          It was only a breeze that went by.\n\n     They hunted till darkness came on, but they found\n          Not a button, or feather, or mark,\n     By which they could tell that they stood on the ground\n          Where the Baker had met with the Snark.\n\n     In the midst of the word he was trying to say,\n          In the midst of his laughter and glee,\n     He had softly and suddenly vanished away---\n          For the Snark _was_ a Boojum, you see.\n\n\n\n                   THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Hunting of the Snark, by Lewis Carroll"}

Despite initial good fortune, the ship is driven south by a storm and eventually reaches Antarctic waters. An albatross appears and leads them out of the ice jam where they are stuck, but even as the albatross is praised by the ship's crew, the mariner shoots the bird:\nWith my cross-bow,\n\nI shot the albatross.\nThe crew is angry with the mariner, believing the albatross brought the south wind that led them out of the Antarctic. However, the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist appears:\n'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,\n\nThat bring the fog and mist.\nThey soon find that they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime, as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship \"from the land of mist and snow\"; the south wind that had initially led them from the land of ice now sends the ship into uncharted waters near the equator, where it is becalmed.\nDay after day, day after day,\n\nWe stuck, nor breath nor motion;\n\nAs idle as a painted ship\n\nUpon a painted ocean.\n\nWater, water, every where,\n\nAnd all the boards did shrink;\n\nWater, water, every where,\n\nNor any drop to drink.\n\nThe very deep did rot â Oh Christ!\n\nThat ever this should be.\n\nYea, slimy things did crawl with legs,\n\nUpon the slimy sea.\nThe sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst. In anger, the crew forces the mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck, perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it, or perhaps as a sign of regret:\nAh! Well a-day! What evil looks\n\nHad I from old and young!\n\nInstead of the cross, the albatross\n\nAbout my neck was hung.\nEventually, the ship encounters a ghostly hulk. On board are Death (a skeleton) and the \"Night-mare Life-in-Death\", a deathly-pale woman, who are playing dice for the souls of the crew. With a roll of the dice, Death wins the lives of the crew members and Life-in-Death the life of the mariner, a prize she considers more valuable. Her name is a clue to the mariner's fate: he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross.\nOne by one, all of the crew members die, but the mariner lives on, seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the crew's corpses, whose last expressions remain upon their faces. Eventually, this stage of the mariner's curse is lifted after he appreciates the sea creatures swimming in the water. Despite his cursing them as \"slimy things\" earlier in the poem, he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them (\"a spring of love gush'd from my heart, and I bless'd them unaware\"); suddenly, as he manages to pray, the albatross falls from his neck and his guilt is partially expiated. The bodies of the crew, possessed by good spirits, rise again and help steer the ship. In a trance, the mariner hears two spirits discussing his voyage and penance, and learns that the ship is being powered preternaturally:\nThe air is cut away before,\n\nAnd closes from behind.\nFinally the mariner comes in sight of his homeland, but is initially uncertain as to whether or not he is hallucinating.\nOh! Dream of joy! Is this indeed\n\nThe light-house top I see?\n\nIs this the hill? Is this the kirk?\n\nIs this mine own countree?\n\nWe drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\n\nAnd I with sobs did prayâ\n\nO let me be awake, my God!\n\nOr let me sleep alway.\nThe rotten remains of the ship sink in a whirlpool, leaving only the mariner behind. A hermit on the mainland had seen the approaching ship and had come to meet it with a pilot and his boy, in a boat. When they pull him from the water, they think he is dead, but when he opens his mouth, the pilot has a fit. The hermit prays, and the mariner picks up the oars to row. The pilot's boy goes crazy and laughs, thinking the mariner is the devil, and cries, \"The Devil knows how to row\". As penance for shooting the albatross, the mariner, driven by guilt, is forced to wander the earth, telling his story over and over, and teaching a lesson to those he meets:\nHe prayeth best, who loveth best\n\nAll things both great and small;\n\nFor the dear God who loveth us,\n\nHe made and loveth all.\nAfter relaying the story, the mariner leaves, and the wedding guest returns home, and wakes the next morning \"a sadder and a wiser man\".\nThe poem received mixed reviews from critics, and Coleridge was once told by the publisher that most of the book's sales were to sailors who thought it was a naval songbook. Coleridge made several modifications to the poem over the years. In the second edition of Lyrical Ballads, published in 1800, he replaced many of the archaic words.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Judy Boss\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER\n\nIN SEVEN PARTS\n\nBy Samuel Taylor Coleridge\n\n\n\nPART THE FIRST.\n\n     It is an ancient Mariner,\n     And he stoppeth one of three.\n     \"By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,\n     Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?\n\n     \"The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,\n     And I am next of kin;\n     The guests are met, the feast is set:\n     May'st hear the merry din.\"\n\n     He holds him with his skinny hand,\n     \"There was a ship,\" quoth he.\n     \"Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!\"\n     Eftsoons his hand dropt he.\n\n     He holds him with his glittering eye--\n     The Wedding-Guest stood still,\n     And listens like a three years child:\n     The Mariner hath his will.\n\n     The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:\n     He cannot chuse but hear;\n     And thus spake on that ancient man,\n     The bright-eyed Mariner.\n\n     The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,\n     Merrily did we drop\n     Below the kirk, below the hill,\n     Below the light-house top.\n\n     The Sun came up upon the left,\n     Out of the sea came he!\n     And he shone bright, and on the right\n     Went down into the sea.\n\n     Higher and higher every day,\n     Till over the mast at noon--\n     The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,\n     For he heard the loud bassoon.\n\n     The bride hath paced into the hall,\n     Red as a rose is she;\n     Nodding their heads before her goes\n     The merry minstrelsy.\n\n     The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,\n     Yet he cannot chuse but hear;\n     And thus spake on that ancient man,\n     The bright-eyed Mariner.\n\n     And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he\n     Was tyrannous and strong:\n     He struck with his o'ertaking wings,\n     And chased south along.\n\n     With sloping masts and dipping prow,\n     As who pursued with yell and blow\n     Still treads the shadow of his foe\n     And forward bends his head,\n     The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,\n     And southward aye we fled.\n\n     And now there came both mist and snow,\n     And it grew wondrous cold:\n     And ice, mast-high, came floating by,\n     As green as emerald.\n\n     And through the drifts the snowy clifts\n     Did send a dismal sheen:\n     Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--\n     The ice was all between.\n\n     The ice was here, the ice was there,\n     The ice was all around:\n     It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,\n     Like noises in a swound!\n\n     At length did cross an Albatross:\n     Thorough the fog it came;\n     As if it had been a Christian soul,\n     We hailed it in God's name.\n\n     It ate the food it ne'er had eat,\n     And round and round it flew.\n     The ice did split with a thunder-fit;\n     The helmsman steered us through!\n\n     And a good south wind sprung up behind;\n     The Albatross did follow,\n     And every day, for food or play,\n     Came to the mariners' hollo!\n\n     In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,\n     It perched for vespers nine;\n     Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,\n     Glimmered the white Moon-shine.\n\n     \"God save thee, ancient Mariner!\n     From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--\n     Why look'st thou so?\"--With my cross-bow\n     I shot the ALBATROSS.\n\n\n\n\nPART THE SECOND.\n\n     The Sun now rose upon the right:\n     Out of the sea came he,\n     Still hid in mist, and on the left\n     Went down into the sea.\n\n     And the good south wind still blew behind\n     But no sweet bird did follow,\n     Nor any day for food or play\n     Came to the mariners' hollo!\n\n     And I had done an hellish thing,\n     And it would work 'em woe:\n     For all averred, I had killed the bird\n     That made the breeze to blow.\n     Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay\n     That made the breeze to blow!\n\n     Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,\n     The glorious Sun uprist:\n     Then all averred, I had killed the bird\n     That brought the fog and mist.\n     'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,\n     That bring the fog and mist.\n\n     The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,\n     The furrow followed free:\n     We were the first that ever burst\n     Into that silent sea.\n\n     Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,\n     'Twas sad as sad could be;\n     And we did speak only to break\n     The silence of the sea!\n\n     All in a hot and copper sky,\n     The bloody Sun, at noon,\n     Right up above the mast did stand,\n     No bigger than the Moon.\n\n     Day after day, day after day,\n     We stuck, nor breath nor motion;\n     As idle as a painted ship\n     Upon a painted ocean.\n\n     Water, water, every where,\n     And all the boards did shrink;\n     Water, water, every where,\n     Nor any drop to drink.\n\n     The very deep did rot: O Christ!\n     That ever this should be!\n     Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs\n     Upon the slimy sea.\n\n     About, about, in reel and rout\n     The death-fires danced at night;\n     The water, like a witch's oils,\n     Burnt green, and blue and white.\n\n     And some in dreams assured were\n     Of the spirit that plagued us so:\n     Nine fathom deep he had followed us\n     From the land of mist and snow.\n\n     And every tongue, through utter drought,\n     Was withered at the root;\n     We could not speak, no more than if\n     We had been choked with soot.\n\n     Ah! well a-day! what evil looks\n     Had I from old and young!\n     Instead of the cross, the Albatross\n     About my neck was hung.\n\n\n\n\nPART THE THIRD.\n\n     There passed a weary time.  Each throat\n     Was parched, and glazed each eye.\n     A weary time! a weary time!\n     How glazed each weary eye,\n     When looking westward, I beheld\n     A something in the sky.\n\n     At first it seemed a little speck,\n     And then it seemed a mist:\n     It moved and moved, and took at last\n     A certain shape, I wist.\n\n     A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!\n     And still it neared and neared:\n     As if it dodged a water-sprite,\n     It plunged and tacked and veered.\n\n     With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\n     We could not laugh nor wail;\n     Through utter drought all dumb we stood!\n     I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,\n     And cried, A sail! a sail!\n\n     With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\n     Agape they heard me call:\n     Gramercy! they for joy did grin,\n     And all at once their breath drew in,\n     As they were drinking all.\n\n     See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!\n     Hither to work us weal;\n     Without a breeze, without a tide,\n     She steadies with upright keel!\n\n     The western wave was all a-flame\n     The day was well nigh done!\n     Almost upon the western wave\n     Rested the broad bright Sun;\n     When that strange shape drove suddenly\n     Betwixt us and the Sun.\n\n     And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,\n     (Heaven's Mother send us grace!)\n     As if through a dungeon-grate he peered,\n     With broad and burning face.\n\n     Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)\n     How fast she nears and nears!\n     Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,\n     Like restless gossameres!\n\n     Are those her ribs through which the Sun\n     Did peer, as through a grate?\n     And is that Woman all her crew?\n     Is that a DEATH? and are there two?\n     Is DEATH that woman's mate?\n\n     Her lips were red, her looks were free,\n     Her locks were yellow as gold:\n     Her skin was as white as leprosy,\n     The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,\n     Who thicks man's blood with cold.\n\n     The naked hulk alongside came,\n     And the twain were casting dice;\n     \"The game is done!  I've won!  I've won!\"\n     Quoth she, and whistles thrice.\n\n     The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:\n     At one stride comes the dark;\n     With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea.\n     Off shot the spectre-bark.\n\n     We listened and looked sideways up!\n     Fear at my heart, as at a cup,\n     My life-blood seemed to sip!\n\n     The stars were dim, and thick the night,\n     The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;\n     From the sails the dew did drip--\n     Till clombe above the eastern bar\n     The horned Moon, with one bright star\n     Within the nether tip.\n\n     One after one, by the star-dogged Moon\n     Too quick for groan or sigh,\n     Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,\n     And cursed me with his eye.\n\n     Four times fifty living men,\n     (And I heard nor sigh nor groan)\n     With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,\n     They dropped down one by one.\n\n     The souls did from their bodies fly,--\n     They fled to bliss or woe!\n     And every soul, it passed me by,\n     Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW!\n\n\n\n\nPART THE FOURTH.\n\n     \"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!\n     I fear thy skinny hand!\n     And thou art long, and lank, and brown,\n     As is the ribbed sea-sand.\n\n     \"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,\n     And thy skinny hand, so brown.\"--\n     Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!\n     This body dropt not down.\n\n     Alone, alone, all, all alone,\n     Alone on a wide wide sea!\n     And never a saint took pity on\n     My soul in agony.\n\n     The many men, so beautiful!\n     And they all dead did lie:\n     And a thousand thousand slimy things\n     Lived on; and so did I.\n\n     I looked upon the rotting sea,\n     And drew my eyes away;\n     I looked upon the rotting deck,\n     And there the dead men lay.\n\n     I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:\n     But or ever a prayer had gusht,\n     A wicked whisper came, and made\n     my heart as dry as dust.\n\n     I closed my lids, and kept them close,\n     And the balls like pulses beat;\n     For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky\n     Lay like a load on my weary eye,\n     And the dead were at my feet.\n\n     The cold sweat melted from their limbs,\n     Nor rot nor reek did they:\n     The look with which they looked on me\n     Had never passed away.\n\n     An orphan's curse would drag to Hell\n     A spirit from on high;\n     But oh! more horrible than that\n     Is a curse in a dead man's eye!\n     Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,\n     And yet I could not die.\n\n     The moving Moon went up the sky,\n     And no where did abide:\n     Softly she was going up,\n     And a star or two beside.\n\n     Her beams bemocked the sultry main,\n     Like April hoar-frost spread;\n     But where the ship's huge shadow lay,\n     The charmed water burnt alway\n     A still and awful red.\n\n     Beyond the shadow of the ship,\n     I watched the water-snakes:\n     They moved in tracks of shining white,\n     And when they reared, the elfish light\n     Fell off in hoary flakes.\n\n     Within the shadow of the ship\n     I watched their rich attire:\n     Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,\n     They coiled and swam; and every track\n     Was a flash of golden fire.\n\n     O happy living things! no tongue\n     Their beauty might declare:\n     A spring of love gushed from my heart,\n     And I blessed them unaware:\n     Sure my kind saint took pity on me,\n     And I blessed them unaware.\n\n     The self same moment I could pray;\n     And from my neck so free\n     The Albatross fell off, and sank\n     Like lead into the sea.\n\n\n\n\nPART THE FIFTH.\n\n     Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,\n     Beloved from pole to pole!\n     To Mary Queen the praise be given!\n     She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,\n     That slid into my soul.\n\n     The silly buckets on the deck,\n     That had so long remained,\n     I dreamt that they were filled with dew;\n     And when I awoke, it rained.\n\n     My lips were wet, my throat was cold,\n     My garments all were dank;\n     Sure I had drunken in my dreams,\n     And still my body drank.\n\n     I moved, and could not feel my limbs:\n     I was so light--almost\n     I thought that I had died in sleep,\n     And was a blessed ghost.\n\n     And soon I heard a roaring wind:\n     It did not come anear;\n     But with its sound it shook the sails,\n     That were so thin and sere.\n\n     The upper air burst into life!\n     And a hundred fire-flags sheen,\n     To and fro they were hurried about!\n     And to and fro, and in and out,\n     The wan stars danced between.\n\n     And the coming wind did roar more loud,\n     And the sails did sigh like sedge;\n     And the rain poured down from one black cloud;\n     The Moon was at its edge.\n\n     The thick black cloud was cleft, and still\n     The Moon was at its side:\n     Like waters shot from some high crag,\n     The lightning fell with never a jag,\n     A river steep and wide.\n\n     The loud wind never reached the ship,\n     Yet now the ship moved on!\n     Beneath the lightning and the Moon\n     The dead men gave a groan.\n\n     They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,\n     Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;\n     It had been strange, even in a dream,\n     To have seen those dead men rise.\n\n     The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;\n     Yet never a breeze up blew;\n     The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,\n     Where they were wont to do:\n     They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--\n     We were a ghastly crew.\n\n     The body of my brother's son,\n     Stood by me, knee to knee:\n     The body and I pulled at one rope,\n     But he said nought to me.\n\n     \"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!\"\n     Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!\n     'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,\n     Which to their corses came again,\n     But a troop of spirits blest:\n\n     For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,\n     And clustered round the mast;\n     Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,\n     And from their bodies passed.\n\n     Around, around, flew each sweet sound,\n     Then darted to the Sun;\n     Slowly the sounds came back again,\n     Now mixed, now one by one.\n\n     Sometimes a-dropping from the sky\n     I heard the sky-lark sing;\n     Sometimes all little birds that are,\n     How they seemed to fill the sea and air\n     With their sweet jargoning!\n\n     And now 'twas like all instruments,\n     Now like a lonely flute;\n     And now it is an angel's song,\n     That makes the Heavens be mute.\n\n     It ceased; yet still the sails made on\n     A pleasant noise till noon,\n     A noise like of a hidden brook\n     In the leafy month of June,\n     That to the sleeping woods all night\n     Singeth a quiet tune.\n\n     Till noon we quietly sailed on,\n     Yet never a breeze did breathe:\n     Slowly and smoothly went the ship,\n     Moved onward from beneath.\n\n     Under the keel nine fathom deep,\n     From the land of mist and snow,\n     The spirit slid: and it was he\n     That made the ship to go.\n     The sails at noon left off their tune,\n     And the ship stood still also.\n\n     The Sun, right up above the mast,\n     Had fixed her to the ocean:\n     But in a minute she 'gan stir,\n     With a short uneasy motion--\n     Backwards and forwards half her length\n     With a short uneasy motion.\n\n     Then like a pawing horse let go,\n     She made a sudden bound:\n     It flung the blood into my head,\n     And I fell down in a swound.\n\n     How long in that same fit I lay,\n     I have not to declare;\n     But ere my living life returned,\n     I heard and in my soul discerned\n     Two VOICES in the air.\n\n     \"Is it he?\" quoth one, \"Is this the man?\n     By him who died on cross,\n     With his cruel bow he laid full low,\n     The harmless Albatross.\n\n     \"The spirit who bideth by himself\n     In the land of mist and snow,\n     He loved the bird that loved the man\n     Who shot him with his bow.\"\n\n     The other was a softer voice,\n     As soft as honey-dew:\n     Quoth he, \"The man hath penance done,\n     And penance more will do.\"\n\n\n\n\nPART THE SIXTH.\n\n\n     FIRST VOICE.\n\n     But tell me, tell me! speak again,\n     Thy soft response renewing--\n     What makes that ship drive on so fast?\n     What is the OCEAN doing?\n\n\n     SECOND VOICE.\n\n     Still as a slave before his lord,\n     The OCEAN hath no blast;\n     His great bright eye most silently\n     Up to the Moon is cast--\n\n     If he may know which way to go;\n     For she guides him smooth or grim\n     See, brother, see! how graciously\n     She looketh down on him.\n\n\n     FIRST VOICE.\n\n     But why drives on that ship so fast,\n     Without or wave or wind?\n\n\n     SECOND VOICE.\n\n     The air is cut away before,\n     And closes from behind.\n\n     Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high\n     Or we shall be belated:\n     For slow and slow that ship will go,\n     When the Mariner's trance is abated.\n\n     I woke, and we were sailing on\n     As in a gentle weather:\n     'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;\n     The dead men stood together.\n\n     All stood together on the deck,\n     For a charnel-dungeon fitter:\n     All fixed on me their stony eyes,\n     That in the Moon did glitter.\n\n     The pang, the curse, with which they died,\n     Had never passed away:\n     I could not draw my eyes from theirs,\n     Nor turn them up to pray.\n\n     And now this spell was snapt: once more\n     I viewed the ocean green.\n     And looked far forth, yet little saw\n     Of what had else been seen--\n\n     Like one that on a lonesome road\n     Doth walk in fear and dread,\n     And having once turned round walks on,\n     And turns no more his head;\n     Because he knows, a frightful fiend\n     Doth close behind him tread.\n\n     But soon there breathed a wind on me,\n     Nor sound nor motion made:\n     Its path was not upon the sea,\n     In ripple or in shade.\n\n     It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek\n     Like a meadow-gale of spring--\n     It mingled strangely with my fears,\n     Yet it felt like a welcoming.\n\n     Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,\n     Yet she sailed softly too:\n     Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--\n     On me alone it blew.\n\n     Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed\n     The light-house top I see?\n     Is this the hill? is this the kirk?\n     Is this mine own countree!\n\n     We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\n     And I with sobs did pray--\n     O let me be awake, my God!\n     Or let me sleep alway.\n\n     The harbour-bay was clear as glass,\n     So smoothly it was strewn!\n     And on the bay the moonlight lay,\n     And the shadow of the moon.\n\n     The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,\n     That stands above the rock:\n     The moonlight steeped in silentness\n     The steady weathercock.\n\n     And the bay was white with silent light,\n     Till rising from the same,\n     Full many shapes, that shadows were,\n     In crimson colours came.\n\n     A little distance from the prow\n     Those crimson shadows were:\n     I turned my eyes upon the deck--\n     Oh, Christ! what saw I there!\n\n     Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,\n     And, by the holy rood!\n     A man all light, a seraph-man,\n     On every corse there stood.\n\n     This seraph band, each waved his hand:\n     It was a heavenly sight!\n     They stood as signals to the land,\n     Each one a lovely light:\n\n     This seraph-band, each waved his hand,\n     No voice did they impart--\n     No voice; but oh! the silence sank\n     Like music on my heart.\n\n     But soon I heard the dash of oars;\n     I heard the Pilot's cheer;\n     My head was turned perforce away,\n     And I saw a boat appear.\n\n     The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy,\n     I heard them coming fast:\n     Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy\n     The dead men could not blast.\n\n     I saw a third--I heard his voice:\n     It is the Hermit good!\n     He singeth loud his godly hymns\n     That he makes in the wood.\n     He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away\n     The Albatross's blood.\n\n\n\n\nPART THE SEVENTH.\n\n     This Hermit good lives in that wood\n     Which slopes down to the sea.\n     How loudly his sweet voice he rears!\n     He loves to talk with marineres\n     That come from a far countree.\n\n     He kneels at morn and noon and eve--\n     He hath a cushion plump:\n     It is the moss that wholly hides\n     The rotted old oak-stump.\n\n     The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,\n     \"Why this is strange, I trow!\n     Where are those lights so many and fair,\n     That signal made but now?\"\n\n     \"Strange, by my faith!\" the Hermit said--\n     \"And they answered not our cheer!\n     The planks looked warped! and see those sails,\n     How thin they are and sere!\n     I never saw aught like to them,\n     Unless perchance it were\n\n     \"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag\n     My forest-brook along;\n     When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,\n     And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,\n     That eats the she-wolf's young.\"\n\n     \"Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--\n     (The Pilot made reply)\n     I am a-feared\"--\"Push on, push on!\"\n     Said the Hermit cheerily.\n\n     The boat came closer to the ship,\n     But I nor spake nor stirred;\n     The boat came close beneath the ship,\n     And straight a sound was heard.\n\n     Under the water it rumbled on,\n     Still louder and more dread:\n     It reached the ship, it split the bay;\n     The ship went down like lead.\n\n     Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,\n     Which sky and ocean smote,\n     Like one that hath been seven days drowned\n     My body lay afloat;\n     But swift as dreams, myself I found\n     Within the Pilot's boat.\n\n     Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,\n     The boat spun round and round;\n     And all was still, save that the hill\n     Was telling of the sound.\n\n     I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked\n     And fell down in a fit;\n     The holy Hermit raised his eyes,\n     And prayed where he did sit.\n\n     I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,\n     Who now doth crazy go,\n     Laughed loud and long, and all the while\n     His eyes went to and fro.\n     \"Ha! ha!\" quoth he, \"full plain I see,\n     The Devil knows how to row.\"\n\n     And now, all in my own countree,\n     I stood on the firm land!\n     The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,\n     And scarcely he could stand.\n\n     \"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!\"\n     The Hermit crossed his brow.\n     \"Say quick,\" quoth he, \"I bid thee say--\n     What manner of man art thou?\"\n\n     Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched\n     With a woeful agony,\n     Which forced me to begin my tale;\n     And then it left me free.\n\n     Since then, at an uncertain hour,\n     That agony returns;\n     And till my ghastly tale is told,\n     This heart within me burns.\n\n     I pass, like night, from land to land;\n     I have strange power of speech;\n     That moment that his face I see,\n     I know the man that must hear me:\n     To him my tale I teach.\n\n     What loud uproar bursts from that door!\n     The wedding-guests are there:\n     But in the garden-bower the bride\n     And bride-maids singing are:\n     And hark the little vesper bell,\n     Which biddeth me to prayer!\n\n     O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been\n     Alone on a wide wide sea:\n     So lonely 'twas, that God himself\n     Scarce seemed there to be.\n\n     O sweeter than the marriage-feast,\n     'Tis sweeter far to me,\n     To walk together to the kirk\n     With a goodly company!--\n\n     To walk together to the kirk,\n     And all together pray,\n     While each to his great Father bends,\n     Old men, and babes, and loving friends,\n     And youths and maidens gay!\n\n     Farewell, farewell! but this I tell\n     To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!\n     He prayeth well, who loveth well\n     Both man and bird and beast.\n\n     He prayeth best, who loveth best\n     All things both great and small;\n     For the dear God who loveth us\n     He made and loveth all.\n\n     The Mariner, whose eye is bright,\n     Whose beard with age is hoar,\n     Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest\n     Turned from the bridegroom's door.\n\n     He went like one that hath been stunned,\n     And is of sense forlorn:\n     A sadder and a wiser man,\n     He rose the morrow morn.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, by \nSamuel Taylor Coleridge"}

The story then jumps 40 years into the future after the Fall and expulsion from Eden.\nIt is one of a series of books Twain wrote concerning the story of Adam and Eve, including Extracts from Adam's Diary, 'That Day In Eden,' 'Eve Speaks,' 'Adam's Soliloquy,' and the 'Autobiography of Eve.' Eve's Diary has a lighter tone than the others in the series, as Eve has a strong appreciation for beauty and love.\nThe book may have been written as a posthumous love-letter to Mark Twain's wife Olivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, just before the story was written. Mark Twain is quoted as saying, \"Eve's Diary is finished â I've been waiting for her to speak, but she doesn't say anything more.\" The story ends with Adam's speaking at Eve's grave, \"Wherever she was, there was Eden.\"", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK EVE'S DIARY, COMPLETE ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by David Widger and Cindy Rosenthal\n\n\n\n\n\nEVE'S DIARY\n\n\nBy Mark Twain\n\n\nIllustrated by Lester Ralph\n\n\n\n\nTranslated from the Original\n\n\n\nSATURDAY.--I am almost a whole day old, now.  I arrived yesterday.\nThat is as it seems to me.  And it must be so, for if there was a\nday-before-yesterday I was not there when it happened, or I should\nremember it.  It could be, of course, that it did happen, and that I\nwas not noticing. Very well; I will be very watchful now, and if any\nday-before-yesterdays happen I will make a note of it. It will be best\nto start right and not let the record get confused, for some instinct\ntells me that these details are going to be important to the historian\nsome day.  For I feel like an experiment, I feel exactly like an\nexperiment; it would be impossible for a person to feel more like an\nexperiment than I do, and so I am coming to feel convinced that that\nis what I AM--an experiment; just an experiment, and nothing more.\n\nThen if I am an experiment, am I the whole of it?  No, I think not; I\nthink the rest of it is part of it.  I am the main part of it, but I\nthink the rest of it has its share in the matter.  Is my position\nassured, or do I have to watch it and take care of it? The latter,\nperhaps.  Some instinct tells me that eternal vigilance is the price\nof supremacy.  [That is a good phrase, I think, for one so young.]\n\nEverything looks better today than it did yesterday.  In the rush of\nfinishing up yesterday, the mountains were left in a ragged condition,\nand some of the plains were so cluttered with rubbish and remnants that\nthe aspects were quite distressing.  Noble and beautiful works of art\nshould not be subjected to haste; and this majestic new world is indeed\na most noble and beautiful work.  And certainly marvelously near to\nbeing perfect, notwithstanding the shortness of the time. There are too\nmany stars in some places and not enough in others, but that can be\nremedied presently, no doubt.  The moon got loose last night, and slid\ndown and fell out of the scheme--a very great loss; it breaks my heart\nto think of it.  There isn't another thing among the ornaments and\ndecorations that is comparable to it for beauty and finish.  It should\nhave been fastened better. If we can only get it back again--\n\nBut of course there is no telling where it went to.  And besides,\nwhoever gets it will hide it; I know it because I would do it myself.\nI believe I can be honest in all other matters, but I already begin to\nrealize that the core and center of my nature is love of the beautiful,\na passion for the beautiful, and that it would not be safe to trust me\nwith a moon that belonged to another person and that person didn't know\nI had it.  I could give up a moon that I found in the daytime, because I\nshould be afraid some one was looking; but if I found it in the dark, I\nam sure I should find some kind of an excuse for not saying anything\nabout it.  For I do love moons, they are so pretty and so romantic.  I\nwish we had five or six; I would never go to bed; I should never get\ntired lying on the moss-bank and looking up at them.\n\nStars are good, too.  I wish I could get some to put in my hair. But I\nsuppose I never can.  You would be surprised to find how far off they\nare, for they do not look it.  When they first showed, last night, I\ntried to knock some down with a pole, but it didn't reach, which\nastonished me; then I tried clods till I was all tired out, but I never\ngot one.  It was because I am left-handed and cannot throw good.  Even\nwhen I aimed at the one I wasn't after I couldn't hit the other one,\nthough I did make some close shots, for I saw the black blot of the clod\nsail right into the midst of the golden clusters forty or fifty times,\njust barely missing them, and if I could have held out a little longer\nmaybe I could have got one.\n\nSo I cried a little, which was natural, I suppose, for one of my age,\nand after I was rested I got a basket and started for a place on the\nextreme rim of the circle, where the stars were close to the ground and\nI could get them with my hands, which would be better, anyway, because I\ncould gather them tenderly then, and not break them. But it was farther\nthan I thought, and at last I had to give it up; I was so tired I\ncouldn't drag my feet another step; and besides, they were sore and hurt\nme very much.\n\nI couldn't get back home; it was too far and turning cold; but I found\nsome tigers and nestled in among them and was most adorably comfortable,\nand their breath was sweet and pleasant, because they live on\nstrawberries.  I had never seen a tiger before, but I knew them in a\nminute by the stripes.  If I could have one of those skins, it would\nmake a lovely gown.\n\nToday I am getting better ideas about distances.  I was so eager to get\nhold of every pretty thing that I giddily grabbed for it, sometimes when\nit was too far off, and sometimes when it was but six inches away but\nseemed a foot--alas, with thorns between! I learned a lesson; also I\nmade an axiom, all out of my own head--my very first one; THE SCRATCHED\nEXPERIMENT SHUNS THE THORN. I think it is a very good one for one so\nyoung.\n\nI followed the other Experiment around, yesterday afternoon, at a\ndistance, to see what it might be for, if I could.  But I was not able\nto make [it] out.  I think it is a man.  I had never seen a man, but it\nlooked like one, and I feel sure that that is what it is. I realize that\nI feel more curiosity about it than about any of the other reptiles.  If\nit is a reptile, and I suppose it is; for it has frowzy hair and blue\neyes, and looks like a reptile. It has no hips; it tapers like a carrot;\nwhen it stands, it spreads itself apart like a derrick; so I think it is\na reptile, though it may be architecture.\n\nI was afraid of it at first, and started to run every time it turned\naround, for I thought it was going to chase me; but by and by I found it\nwas only trying to get away, so after that I was not timid any more, but\ntracked it along, several hours, about twenty yards behind, which made\nit nervous and unhappy. At last it was a good deal worried, and climbed\na tree.  I waited a good while, then gave it up and went home.\n\nToday the same thing over.  I've got it up the tree again.\n\n\n\nSUNDAY.--It is up there yet.  Resting, apparently.  But that is a\nsubterfuge:  Sunday isn't the day of rest; Saturday is appointed for\nthat.  It looks to me like a creature that is more interested in resting\nthan in anything else.  It would tire me to rest so much. It tires me\njust to sit around and watch the tree.  I do wonder what it is for; I\nnever see it do anything.\n\nThey returned the moon last night, and I was SO happy!  I think it is\nvery honest of them.  It slid down and fell off again, but I was not\ndistressed; there is no need to worry when one has that kind of\nneighbors; they will fetch it back.  I wish I could do something to show\nmy appreciation.  I would like to send them some stars, for we have more\nthan we can use.  I mean I, not we, for I can see that the reptile cares\nnothing for such things.\n\nIt has low tastes, and is not kind.  When I went there yesterday evening\nin the gloaming it had crept down and was trying to catch the little\nspeckled fishes that play in the pool, and I had to clod it to make it\ngo up the tree again and let them alone. I wonder if THAT is what it is\nfor?  Hasn't it any heart? Hasn't it any compassion for those little\ncreature?  Can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such\nungentle work? It has the look of it.  One of the clods took it back of\nthe ear, and it used language.  It gave me a thrill, for it was the\nfirst time I had ever heard speech, except my own.  I did not understand\nthe words, but they seemed expressive.\n\nWhen I found it could talk I felt a new interest in it, for I love to\ntalk; I talk, all day, and in my sleep, too, and I am very interesting,\nbut if I had another to talk to I could be twice as interesting, and\nwould never stop, if desired.\n\nIf this reptile is a man, it isn't an IT, is it?  That wouldn't be\ngrammatical, would it?  I think it would be HE.  I think so. In that\ncase one would parse it thus:  nominative, HE; dative, HIM; possessive,\nHIS'N. Well, I will consider it a man and call it he until it turns out\nto be something else.  This will be handier than having so many\nuncertainties.\n\n\n\nNEXT WEEK SUNDAY.--All the week I tagged around after him and tried to\nget acquainted.  I had to do the talking, because he was shy, but I\ndidn't mind it.  He seemed pleased to have me around, and I used the\nsociable âweâ a good deal, because it seemed to flatter him to be\nincluded.\n\n\n\nWEDNESDAY.--We are getting along very well indeed, now, and getting\nbetter and better acquainted.  He does not try to avoid me any more,\nwhich is a good sign, and shows that he likes to have me with him. That\npleases me, and I study to be useful to him in every way I can, so as to\nincrease his regard.\n\nDuring the last day or two I have taken all the work of naming things\noff his hands, and this has been a great relief to him, for he has no\ngift in that line, and is evidently very grateful.  He can't think of a\nrational name to save him, but I do not let him see that I am aware of\nhis defect. Whenever a new creature comes along I name it before he has\ntime to expose himself by an awkward silence.  In this way I have saved\nhim many embarrassments.  I have no defect like this. The minute I set\neyes on an animal I know what it is.  I don't have to reflect a moment;\nthe right name comes out instantly, just as if it were an inspiration,\nas no doubt it is, for I am sure it wasn't in me half a minute before.\nI seem to know just by the shape of the creature and the way it acts\nwhat animal it is.\n\nWhen the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcat--I saw it in his\neye.  But I saved him.  And I was careful not to do it in a way that\ncould hurt his pride.  I just spoke up in a quite natural way of\npleasing surprise, and not as if I was dreaming of conveying\ninformation, and said, âWell, I do declare, if there isn't the dodo!â  I\nexplained--without seeming to be explaining--how I know it for a dodo,\nand although I thought maybe he was a little piqued that I knew the\ncreature when he didn't, it was quite evident that he admired me.  That\nwas very agreeable, and I thought of it more than once with\ngratification before I slept. How little a thing can make us happy when\nwe feel that we have earned it!\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY.--my first sorrow.  Yesterday he avoided me and seemed to wish\nI would not talk to him.  I could not believe it, and thought there was\nsome mistake, for I loved to be with him, and loved to hear him talk,\nand so how could it be that he could feel unkind toward me when I had\nnot done anything?  But at last it seemed true, so I went away and sat\nlonely in the place where I first saw him the morning that we were made\nand I did not know what he was and was indifferent about him; but now it\nwas a mournful place, and every little thing spoke of him, and my heart\nwas very sore. I did not know why very clearly, for it was a new\nfeeling; I had not experienced it before, and it was all a mystery, and\nI could not make it out.\n\nBut when night came I could not bear the lonesomeness, and went to the\nnew shelter which he has built, to ask him what I had done that was\nwrong and how I could mend it and get back his kindness again; but he\nput me out in the rain, and it was my first sorrow.\n\n\n\nSUNDAY.--It is pleasant again, now, and I am happy; but those were heavy\ndays; I do not think of them when I can help it.\n\nI tried to get him some of those apples, but I cannot learn to throw\nstraight.  I failed, but I think the good intention pleased him. They\nare forbidden, and he says I shall come to harm; but so I come to harm\nthrough pleasing him, why shall I care for that harm?\n\n\n\nMONDAY.--This morning I told him my name, hoping it would interest him.\nBut he did not care for it.  It is strange.  If he should tell me his\nname, I would care.  I think it would be pleasanter in my ears than any\nother sound.\n\nHe talks very little.  Perhaps it is because he is not bright, and is\nsensitive about it and wishes to conceal it.  It is such a pity that he\nshould feel so, for brightness is nothing; it is in the heart that the\nvalues lie.  I wish I could make him understand that a loving good heart\nis riches, and riches enough, and that without it intellect is poverty.\n\nAlthough he talks so little, he has quite a considerable vocabulary.\nThis morning he used a surprisingly good word. He evidently recognized,\nhimself, that it was a good one, for he worked it in twice afterward,\ncasually.  It was good casual art, still it showed that he possesses a\ncertain quality of perception. Without a doubt that seed can be made to\ngrow, if cultivated.\n\nWhere did he get that word?  I do not think I have ever used it.\n\nNo, he took no interest in my name.  I tried to hide my disappointment,\nbut I suppose I did not succeed.  I went away and sat on the moss-bank\nwith my feet in the water.  It is where I go when I hunger for\ncompanionship, some one to look at, some one to talk to. It is not\nenough--that lovely white body painted there in the pool--but it is\nsomething, and something is better than utter loneliness. It talks when\nI talk; it is sad when I am sad; it comforts me with its sympathy; it\nsays, âDo not be downhearted, you poor friendless girl; I will be your\nfriend.â  It IS a good friend to me, and my only one; it is my sister.\n\nThat first time that she forsook me! ah, I shall never forget that\n--never, never.  My heart was lead in my body!  I said, âShe was all I\nhad, and now she is gone!â  In my despair I said, âBreak, my heart; I\ncannot bear my life any more!â and hid my face in my hands, and there\nwas no solace for me.  And when I took them away, after a little, there\nshe was again, white and shining and beautiful, and I sprang into her\narms!\n\nThat was perfect happiness; I had known happiness before, but it was not\nlike this, which was ecstasy.  I never doubted her afterward. Sometimes\nshe stayed away--maybe an hour, maybe almost the whole day, but I waited\nand did not doubt; I said, âShe is busy, or she is gone on a journey,\nbut she will come.â  And it was so: she always did.  At night she would\nnot come if it was dark, for she was a timid little thing; but if there\nwas a moon she would come. I am not afraid of the dark, but she is\nyounger than I am; she was born after I was.  Many and many are the\nvisits I have paid her; she is my comfort and my refuge when my life is\nhard--and it is mainly that.\n\n\n\nTUESDAY.--All the morning I was at work improving the estate; and I\npurposely kept away from him in the hope that he would get lonely and\ncome.  But he did not.\n\nAt noon I stopped for the day and took my recreation by flitting all\nabout with the bees and the butterflies and reveling in the flowers,\nthose beautiful creatures that catch the smile of God out of the sky and\npreserve it!  I gathered them, and made them into wreaths and garlands\nand clothed myself in them while I ate my luncheon--apples, of course;\nthen I sat in the shade and wished and waited. But he did not come.\n\nBut no matter.  Nothing would have come of it, for he does not care for\nflowers.  He called them rubbish, and cannot tell one from another, and\nthinks it is superior to feel like that.  He does not care for me, he\ndoes not care for flowers, he does not care for the painted sky at\neventide--is there anything he does care for, except building shacks to\ncoop himself up in from the good clean rain, and thumping the melons,\nand sampling the grapes, and fingering the fruit on the trees, to see\nhow those properties are coming along?\n\nI laid a dry stick on the ground and tried to bore a hole in it with\nanother one, in order to carry out a scheme that I had, and soon I got\nan awful fright.  A thin, transparent bluish film rose out of the hole,\nand I dropped everything and ran!  I thought it was a spirit, and I WAS\nso frightened!  But I looked back, and it was not coming; so I leaned\nagainst a rock and rested and panted, and let my limbs go on trembling\nuntil they got steady again; then I crept warily back, alert, watching,\nand ready to fly if there was occasion; and when I was come near, I\nparted the branches of a rose-bush and peeped through--wishing the man\nwas about, I was looking so cunning and pretty--but the sprite was gone.\nI went there, and there was a pinch of delicate pink dust in the hole. I\nput my finger in, to feel it, and said OUCH! and took it out again.  It\nwas a cruel pain.  I put my finger in my mouth; and by standing first on\none foot and then the other, and grunting, I presently eased my misery;\nthen I was full of interest, and began to examine.\n\nI was curious to know what the pink dust was.  Suddenly the name of it\noccurred to me, though I had never heard of it before.  It was FIRE! I\nwas as certain of it as a person could be of anything in the world. So\nwithout hesitation I named it that--fire.\n\nI had created something that didn't exist before; I had added a new\nthing to the world's uncountable properties; I realized this, and was\nproud of my achievement, and was going to run and find him and tell him\nabout it, thinking to raise myself in his esteem--but I reflected, and\ndid not do it.  No--he would not care for it. He would ask what it was\ngood for, and what could I answer? for if it was not GOOD for something,\nbut only beautiful, merely beautiful--\n\nSo I sighed, and did not go.  For it wasn't good for anything; it could\nnot build a shack, it could not improve melons, it could not hurry a\nfruit crop; it was useless, it was a foolishness and a vanity; he would\ndespise it and say cutting words. But to me it was not despicable; I\nsaid, âOh, you fire, I love you, you dainty pink creature, for you are\nBEAUTIFUL--and that is enough!â and was going to gather it to my breast.\nBut refrained. Then I made another maxim out of my head, though it was\nso nearly like the first one that I was afraid it was only a plagiarism:\nâTHE BURNT EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE FIRE.â\n\nI wrought again; and when I had made a good deal of fire-dust I emptied\nit into a handful of dry brown grass, intending to carry it home and\nkeep it always and play with it; but the wind struck it and it sprayed\nup and spat out at me fiercely, and I dropped it and ran. When I looked\nback the blue spirit was towering up and stretching and rolling away\nlike a cloud, and instantly I thought of the name of it--SMOKE!--though,\nupon my word, I had never heard of smoke before.\n\nSoon brilliant yellow and red flares shot up through the smoke, and I\nnamed them in an instant--FLAMES--and I was right, too, though these\nwere the very first flames that had ever been in the world.  They\nclimbed the trees, then flashed splendidly in and out of the vast and\nincreasing volume of tumbling smoke, and I had to clap my hands and\nlaugh and dance in my rapture, it was so new and strange and so\nwonderful and so beautiful!\n\nHe came running, and stopped and gazed, and said not a word for many\nminutes.  Then he asked what it was.  Ah, it was too bad that he should\nask such a direct question.  I had to answer it, of course, and I did.\nI said it was fire.  If it annoyed him that I should know and he must\nask; that was not my fault; I had no desire to annoy him. After a pause\nhe asked:\n\nâHow did it come?â\n\nAnother direct question, and it also had to have a direct answer.\n\nâI made it.â\n\nThe fire was traveling farther and farther off.  He went to the edge of\nthe burned place and stood looking down, and said:\n\nâWhat are these?â\n\nâFire-coals.â\n\nHe picked up one to examine it, but changed his mind and put it down\nagain.  Then he went away.  NOTHING interests him.\n\nBut I was interested.  There were ashes, gray and soft and delicate and\npretty--I knew what they were at once.  And the embers; I knew the\nembers, too.  I found my apples, and raked them out, and was glad; for I\nam very young and my appetite is active. But I was disappointed; they\nwere all burst open and spoiled. Spoiled apparently; but it was not so;\nthey were better than raw ones. Fire is beautiful; some day it will be\nuseful, I think.\n\n\n\nFRIDAY.--I saw him again, for a moment, last Monday at nightfall, but\nonly for a moment.  I was hoping he would praise me for trying to\nimprove the estate, for I had meant well and had worked hard. But he was\nnot pleased, and turned away and left me.  He was also displeased on\nanother account:  I tried once more to persuade him to stop going over\nthe Falls.  That was because the fire had revealed to me a new passion\n--quite new, and distinctly different from love, grief, and those others\nwhich I had already discovered--FEAR.  And it is horrible!--I wish I had\nnever discovered it; it gives me dark moments, it spoils my happiness,\nit makes me shiver and tremble and shudder. But I could not persuade\nhim, for he has not discovered fear yet, and so he could not understand\nme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTRACT FROM ADAM'S DIARY\n\n\nPerhaps I ought to remember that she is very young, a mere girl and make\nallowances.  She is all interest, eagerness, vivacity, the world is to\nher a charm, a wonder, a mystery, a joy; she can't speak for delight\nwhen she finds a new flower, she must pet it and caress it and smell it\nand talk to it, and pour out endearing names upon it. And she is\ncolor-mad: brown rocks, yellow sand, gray moss, green foliage, blue sky;\nthe pearl of the dawn, the purple shadows on the mountains, the golden\nislands floating in crimson seas at sunset, the pallid moon sailing\nthrough the shredded cloud-rack, the star-jewels glittering in the\nwastes of space--none of them is of any practical value, so far as I can\nsee, but because they have color and majesty, that is enough for her,\nand she loses her mind over them. If she could quiet down and keep still\na couple minutes at a time, it would be a reposeful spectacle.  In that\ncase I think I could enjoy looking at her; indeed I am sure I could, for\nI am coming to realize that she is a quite remarkably comely creature\n--lithe, slender, trim, rounded, shapely, nimble, graceful; and once\nwhen she was standing marble-white and sun-drenched on a boulder, with\nher young head tilted back and her hand shading her eyes, watching the\nflight of a bird in the sky, I recognized that she was beautiful.\n\n\n\nMONDAY NOON.--If there is anything on the planet that she is not\ninterested in it is not in my list.  There are animals that I am\nindifferent to, but it is not so with her.  She has no discrimination,\nshe takes to all of them, she thinks they are all treasures, every new\none is welcome.\n\nWhen the mighty brontosaurus came striding into camp, she regarded it as\nan acquisition, I considered it a calamity; that is a good sample of the\nlack of harmony that prevails in our views of things. She wanted to\ndomesticate it, I wanted to make it a present of the homestead and move\nout.  She believed it could be tamed by kind treatment and would be a\ngood pet; I said a pet twenty-one feet high and eighty-four feet long\nwould be no proper thing to have about the place, because, even with the\nbest intentions and without meaning any harm, it could sit down on the\nhouse and mash it, for any one could see by the look of its eye that it\nwas absent-minded.\n\nStill, her heart was set upon having that monster, and she couldn't give\nit up.  She thought we could start a dairy with it, and wanted me to\nhelp milk it; but I wouldn't; it was too risky. The sex wasn't right,\nand we hadn't any ladder anyway.  Then she wanted to ride it, and look\nat the scenery.  Thirty or forty feet of its tail was lying on the\nground, like a fallen tree, and she thought she could climb it, but she\nwas mistaken; when she got to the steep place it was too slick and down\nshe came, and would have hurt herself but for me.\n\nWas she satisfied now?  No. Nothing ever satisfies her but\ndemonstration; untested theories are not in her line, and she won't have\nthem. It is the right spirit, I concede it; it attracts me; I feel the\ninfluence of it; if I were with her more I think I should take it up\nmyself.  Well, she had one theory remaining about this colossus: she\nthought that if we could tame it and make him friendly we could stand in\nthe river and use him for a bridge.  It turned out that he was already\nplenty tame enough--at least as far as she was concerned--so she tried\nher theory, but it failed:  every time she got him properly placed in\nthe river and went ashore to cross over him, he came out and followed\nher around like a pet mountain.  Like the other animals.  They all do\nthat.\n\n\n\nTuesday--Wednesday--Thursday--and today:  all without seeing him.  It is\na long time to be alone; still, it is better to be alone than unwelcome.\n\n\n\nFRIDAY--I HAD to have company--I was made for it, I think--so I made\nfriends with the animals.  They are just charming, and they have the\nkindest disposition and the politest ways; they never look sour, they\nnever let you feel that you are intruding, they smile at you and wag\ntheir tail, if they've got one, and they are always ready for a romp or\nan excursion or anything you want to propose. I think they are perfect\ngentlemen.  All these days we have had such good times, and it hasn't\nbeen lonesome for me, ever.\n\nLonesome!  No, I should say not.  Why, there's always a swarm of them\naround--sometimes as much as four or five acres--you can't count them;\nand when you stand on a rock in the midst and look out over the furry\nexpanse it is so mottled and splashed and gay with color and frisking\nsheen and sun-flash, and so rippled with stripes, that you might think\nit was a lake, only you know it isn't; and there's storms of sociable\nbirds, and hurricanes of whirring wings; and when the sun strikes all\nthat feathery commotion, you have a blazing up of all the colors you can\nthink of, enough to put your eyes out.\n\nWe have made long excursions, and I have seen a great deal of the world;\nalmost all of it, I think; and so I am the first traveler, and the only\none.  When we are on the march, it is an imposing sight--there's nothing\nlike it anywhere.  For comfort I ride a tiger or a leopard, because it\nis soft and has a round back that fits me, and because they are such\npretty animals; but for long distance or for scenery I ride the\nelephant.  He hoists me up with his trunk, but I can get off myself;\nwhen we are ready to camp, he sits and I slide down the back way.\n\nThe birds and animals are all friendly to each other, and there are no\ndisputes about anything.  They all talk, and they all talk to me, but it\nmust be a foreign language, for I cannot make out a word they say; yet\nthey often understand me when I talk back, particularly the dog and the\nelephant.  It makes me ashamed. It shows that they are brighter than I\nam, for I want to be the principal Experiment myself--and I intend to\nbe, too.\n\nI have learned a number of things, and am educated, now, but I wasn't at\nfirst.  I was ignorant at first.  At first it used to vex me because,\nwith all my watching, I was never smart enough to be around when the\nwater was running uphill; but now I do not mind it. I have experimented\nand experimented until now I know it never does run uphill, except in\nthe dark.  I know it does in the dark, because the pool never goes dry,\nwhich it would, of course, if the water didn't come back in the night.\nIt is best to prove things by actual experiment; then you KNOW; whereas\nif you depend on guessing and supposing and conjecturing, you never get\neducated.\n\nSome things you CAN'T find out; but you will never know you can't by\nguessing and supposing:  no, you have to be patient and go on\nexperimenting until you find out that you can't find out.  And it is\ndelightful to have it that way, it makes the world so interesting. If\nthere wasn't anything to find out, it would be dull.  Even trying to\nfind out and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find\nout and finding out, and I don't know but more so. The secret of the\nwater was a treasure until I GOT it; then the excitement all went away,\nand I recognized a sense of loss.\n\nBy experiment I know that wood swims, and dry leaves, and feathers, and\nplenty of other things; therefore by all that cumulative evidence you\nknow that a rock will swim; but you have to put up with simply knowing\nit, for there isn't any way to prove it--up to now. But I shall find a\nway--then THAT excitement will go.  Such things make me sad; because by\nand by when I have found out everything there won't be any more\nexcitements, and I do love excitements so! The other night I couldn't\nsleep for thinking about it.\n\nAt first I couldn't make out what I was made for, but now I think it was\nto search out the secrets of this wonderful world and be happy and thank\nthe Giver of it all for devising it.  I think there are many things to\nlearn yet--I hope so; and by economizing and not hurrying too fast I\nthink they will last weeks and weeks.  I hope so.  When you cast up a\nfeather it sails away on the air and goes out of sight; then you throw\nup a clod and it doesn't. It comes down, every time. I have tried it and\ntried it, and it is always so.  I wonder why it is?  Of course it\nDOESN'T come down, but why should it SEEM to? I suppose it is an optical\nillusion.  I mean, one of them is. I don't know which one.  It may be\nthe feather, it may be the clod; I can't prove which it is, I can only\ndemonstrate that one or the other is a fake, and let a person take his\nchoice.\n\nBy watching, I know that the stars are not going to last. I have seen\nsome of the best ones melt and run down the sky. Since one can melt,\nthey can all melt; since they can all melt, they can all melt the same\nnight.  That sorrow will come--I know it. I mean to sit up every night\nand look at them as long as I can keep awake; and I will impress those\nsparkling fields on my memory, so that by and by when they are taken\naway I can by my fancy restore those lovely myriads to the black sky and\nmake them sparkle again, and double them by the blur of my tears.\n\n\n\nAfter the Fall\n\nWhen I look back, the Garden is a dream to me.  It was beautiful,\nsurpassingly beautiful, enchantingly beautiful; and now it is lost, and\nI shall not see it any more.\n\nThe Garden is lost, but I have found HIM, and am content. He loves me as\nwell as he can; I love him with all the strength of my passionate\nnature, and this, I think, is proper to my youth and sex.  If I ask\nmyself why I love him, I find I do not know, and do not really much care\nto know; so I suppose that this kind of love is not a product of\nreasoning and statistics, like one's love for other reptiles and\nanimals.  I think that this must be so. I love certain birds because of\ntheir song; but I do not love Adam on account of his singing--no, it is\nnot that; the more he sings the more I do not get reconciled to it.  Yet\nI ask him to sing, because I wish to learn to like everything he is\ninterested in. I am sure I can learn, because at first I could not stand\nit, but now I can.  It sours the milk, but it doesn't matter; I can get\nused to that kind of milk.\n\nIt is not on account of his brightness that I love him--no, it is not\nthat.  He is not to blame for his brightness, such as it is, for he did\nnot make it himself; he is as God make him, and that is sufficient.\nThere was a wise purpose in it, THAT I know. In time it will develop,\nthough I think it will not be sudden; and besides, there is no hurry; he\nis well enough just as he is.\n\nIt is not on account of his gracious and considerate ways and his\ndelicacy that I love him.  No, he has lacks in this regard, but he is\nwell enough just so, and is improving.\n\nIt is not on account of his industry that I love him--no, it is not\nthat.  I think he has it in him, and I do not know why he conceals it\nfrom me.  It is my only pain.  Otherwise he is frank and open with me,\nnow.  I am sure he keeps nothing from me but this. It grieves me that he\nshould have a secret from me, and sometimes it spoils my sleep, thinking\nof it, but I will put it out of my mind; it shall not trouble my\nhappiness, which is otherwise full to overflowing.\n\nIt is not on account of his education that I love him--no, it is not\nthat.  He is self-educated, and does really know a multitude of things,\nbut they are not so.\n\nIt is not on account of his chivalry that I love him--no, it is not\nthat. He told on me, but I do not blame him; it is a peculiarity of sex,\nI think, and he did not make his sex.  Of course I would not have told\non him, I would have perished first; but that is a peculiarity of sex,\ntoo, and I do not take credit for it, for I did not make my sex.\n\nThen why is it that I love him?  MERELY BECAUSE HE IS MASCULINE, I\nthink.\n\nAt bottom he is good, and I love him for that, but I could love him\nwithout it.  If he should beat me and abuse me, I should go on loving\nhim.  I know it.  It is a matter of sex, I think.\n\nHe is strong and handsome, and I love him for that, and I admire him and\nam proud of him, but I could love him without those qualities. If he\nwere plain, I should love him; if he were a wreck, I should love him;\nand I would work for him, and slave over him, and pray for him, and\nwatch by his bedside until I died.\n\nYes, I think I love him merely because he is MINE and is MASCULINE.\nThere is no other reason, I suppose.  And so I think it is as I first\nsaid:  that this kind of love is not a product of reasonings and\nstatistics.  It just COMES--none knows whence--and cannot explain\nitself.  And doesn't need to.\n\nIt is what I think.

{"doc_id": "ab6a331009ebcbd2600bc3899b7f31c502344ce1", "token_count": 10099, "summary": " The story begins with an account of how geologists in the mid-1960s came to understand that the \"Kiowa fault\" in the state of Colorado was actually part of a larger fault system running along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains from Texas to the CanadaâUS border. In the summer of 1973 the land east of the fault slips downward, slowly but inexorably over the next few months, until the major rivers of the region (including the Mississippi) flood the new lowlands. The process is slow enough for people to flee eastwards, though conditions become more and more hazardous as the flooding increases.\nThe story recounts how, during this time the various authorities such as the Federal government and the State governors, try to quell panic by invoking patriotism or, in the case of the governors, the stalwart nature of the people of the \"great Southland\".\nHowever the next act of nature proves even more cataclysmic. The Gulf coast of the United States, from western Florida to Lake Pontchartrain, simply sinks below sea level. The sea floods the new lowlands from the Texas Panhandle to North Dakota. As many as 14 million people perish. The state of Oklahoma is completely lost, as are most of the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. The Ozarks become an archipelago.\nThere are tales of amazing escapes mentioned in the story, and of foolishness, as for instance when the governor of Kansas decides to stand fast and is wiped out along with most of his state.\nFinally the country is left divided by a new inland sea, almost as big as the Mediterranean. The economy recovers, and the climate of the inner part of the country actually improves due to the moderating effect of this large body of water. The state of Wyoming becomes \"a new Riviera\" while Missouri is a \"second California\". Minnesota loses its famously Arctic winters.\nThe author comments wryly on the political fallout. The states which kept some portion of their land above water eventually demand their full representation in Congress, including two Senators each for several states which exist only as slivers of land.\nTrade and commerce flourish on the new waterway. Eventually the new sea can be fished to great profit. The story ends with an optimistic view of a vibrant future in which \"fleets of all the world sail...where once the prairie schooner made its laborious and dusty way west!\".", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEA ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEA\n\n                            By ALLAN DANZIG\n\n                          Illustrated by WOOD\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                     Galaxy Magazine August 1963.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n          It has happened a hundred times in the long history\n          of Earth--and, sooner or later, will happen again!\n\n\nEveryone--all the geologists, at any rate--had known about the Kiowa\nFault for years. That was before there was anything very interesting\nto know about it. The first survey of Colorado traced its course north\nand south in the narrow valley of Kiowa Creek about twenty miles east\nof Denver; it extended south to the Arkansas River. And that was about\nall even the professionals were interested in knowing. There was never\nso much as a landslide to bring the Fault to the attention of the\ngeneral public.\n\nIt was still a matter of academic interest when in the late '40s\ngeologists speculated on the relationship between the Kiowa Fault and\nthe Conchas Fault farther south, in New Mexico, and which followed the\nPecos as far south as Texas.\n\nNor was there much in the papers a few years later when it was\nsuggested that the Niobrara Fault (just inside and roughly parallel to\nthe eastern border of Wyoming) was a northerly extension of the Kiowa.\nBy the mid sixties it was definitely established that the three Faults\nwere in fact a single line of fissure in the essential rock, stretching\nalmost from the Canadian border well south of the New Mexico-Texas line.\n\nIt is not really surprising that it took so long to figure out the\nconnection. The population of the states affected was in places as\nlow as five people per square mile! The land was so dry it seemed\nimpossible that it could ever be used except for sheep-farming.\n\nIt strikes us today as ironic that from the late '50s there was grave\nconcern about the level of the water table throughout the entire area.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe even more ironic solution to the problem began in the summer of\n1973. It had been a particularly hot and dry August, and the Forestry\nService was keeping an anxious eye out for the fires it knew it could\nexpect. Dense smoke was reported rising above a virtually uninhabited\narea along Black Squirrel Creek, and a plane was sent out for a report.\n\nThe report was--no fire at all. The rising cloud was not smoke, but\ndust. Thousands of cubic feet of dry earth rising lazily on the summer\nair. Rock slides, they guessed; certainly no fire. The Forestry Service\nhad other worries at the moment, and filed the report.\n\nBut after a week had gone by, the town of Edison, a good twenty miles\naway from the slides, was still complaining of the dust. Springs was\ngoing dry, too, apparently from underground disturbances. Not even in\nthe Rockies could anyone remember a series of rock slides as bad as\nthis.\n\nNewspapers in the mountain states gave it a few inches on the front\npage; anything is news in late August. And the geologists became\ninterested. Seismologists were reporting unusual activity in the area,\ntremors too severe to be rock slides. Volcanic activity? Specifically,\na dust volcano? Unusual, they knew, but right on the Kiowa Fault--could\nbe.\n\nLabor Day crowds read the scientific conjectures with late summer\nlassitude. Sunday supplements ran four-color artists' conceptions of\nthe possible volcano. \"Only Active Volcano in U. S.?\" demanded the\nheadlines, and some papers even left off the question mark.\n\nIt may seem odd that the simplest explanation was practically not\nmentioned. Only Joseph Schwartzberg, head geographer of the Department\nof the Interior, wondered if the disturbance might not be a settling\nof the Kiowa Fault. His suggestion was mentioned on page nine or ten\nof the Monday newspapers (page 27 of the New York _Times_). The idea\nwas not nearly so exciting as a volcano, even a lava-less one, and you\ncouldn't draw a very dramatic picture of it.\n\nTo excuse the other geologists, it must be said that the Kiowa Fault\nhad never acted up before. It never sidestepped, never jiggled,\nnever, never produced the regular shows of its little sister out in\nCalifornia, which almost daily bounced San Francisco or Los Angeles, or\nsome place in between. The dust volcano was on the face of it a more\nplausible theory.\n\nStill, it was only a theory. It had to be proved. As the tremors grew\nbigger, along with the affected area, as several towns including\nEdison were shaken to pieces by incredible earthquakes, whole bus- and\nplane-loads of geologists set out for Colorado, without even waiting\nfor their university and government department to approve budgets.\n\nThey found, of course, that Schwartzberg had been perfectly correct.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey found themselves on the scene of what was fast becoming the\nmost violent and widespread earthquake North America--probably the\nworld--has ever seen in historic times. To describe it in the simplest\nterms, land east of the Fault was settling, and at a precipitous rate.\n\nRock scraped rock with a whining roar. Shuddery as a squeaky piece of\nchalk raked across a blackboard, the noise was deafening. The surfaces\nof the land east and west of the Fault seemed no longer to have any\nrelation to each other. To the west, tortured rock reared into cliffs.\nEast, where sharp reports and muffled wheezes told of continued\nbuckling and dropping, the earth trembled downward. Atop the new\ncliffs, which seemed to grow by sudden inches from heaving rubble, dry\nearth fissured and trembled, sliding acres at a time to fall, smoking,\ninto the bucking, heaving bottom of the depression.\n\nThere the devastation was even more thorough, if less spectacular.\nDry earth churned like mud, and rock shards weighing tons bumped and\nrolled about like pebbles as they shivered and cracked into pebbles\nthemselves. \"It looks like sand dancing in a child's sieve,\" said the\nnormally impassive Schwartzberg in a nationwide broadcast from the\nscene of disaster. \"No one here has ever seen anything like it.\" And\nthe landslip was growing, north and south along the Fault.\n\n\"Get out while you can,\" Schwartzberg urged the population of the\naffected area. \"When it's over you can come back and pick up the\npieces.\" But the band of scientists who had rallied to his leadership\nprivately wondered if there would be any pieces.\n\nThe Arkansas River, at Avondale and North Avondale, was sluggishly\nbacking north into the deepening trough. At the rate things were going,\nthere might be a new lake the entire length of El Paso and Pueblo\nCounties. And, warned Schwartzberg, this might only be the beginning.\n\nBy 16 September the landslip had crept down the Huerfano River past\nCedarwood. Avondale, North Avondale and Boone had totally disappeared.\nLand west of the Fault was holding firm, though Denver had recorded\nseveral small tremors; everywhere east of the Fault, to almost twenty\nmiles away, the now-familiar lurch and steady fall had already sent\nseveral thousand Coloradans scurrying for safety.\n\nAll mountain climbing was prohibited on the Eastern Slope because of\nthe danger of rock slides from minor quakes. The geologists went home\nto wait.\n\nThere wasn't much to wait for. The news got worse and worse. The Platte\nRiver, now, was creating a vast mud puddle where the town of Orchard\nhad been. Just below Masters, Colorado, the river leaped 70-foot cliffs\nto add to the heaving chaos below. And the cliffs were higher every day\nas the land beneath them groaned downward in mile-square gulps.\n\nAs the Fault moved north and south, new areas quivered into unwelcome\nlife. Fields and whole mountainsides moved with deceptive sloth down,\ndown. They danced \"like sand in a sieve\"; dry, they boiled into rubble.\nTelephone lines, railroad tracks, roads snapped and simply disappeared.\nVirtually all east-west land communication was suspended and the\nPresident declared a national emergency.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy 23 September the Fault was active well into Wyoming on the north,\nand rapidly approaching the border of New Mexico to the south.\nTrinchera and Branson were totally evacuated, but even so the over-all\ndeath toll had risen above 1,000.\n\nAway to the east the situation was quiet but even more ominous.\nTremendous fissures opened up perpendicular to the Fault, and a general\nsubsidence of the land was noticeable well into Kansas and Nebraska.\nThe western borders of these states, and soon of the Dakotas and\nOklahoma as well, were slowly sinking.\n\nOn the actual scene of the disaster (or the _scenes_; it is impossible\nto speak of anything this size in the singular) there was a horrifying\nconfusion. Prairie and hill cracked open under intolerable strains as\nthe land shuddered downward in gasps and leaps. Springs burst to the\nsurface in hot geysers and explosions of steam.\n\nThe downtown section of North Platte, Nebraska, dropped eight feet,\njust like that, on the afternoon of 4 October. \"We must remain calm,\"\ndeclared the Governor of Nebraska. \"We must sit this thing out. Be\nassured that everything possible is being done.\" But what could be\ndone, with his state dropping straight down at a mean rate of a foot a\nday?\n\nThe Fault nicked off the south-east corner of Montana. It worked its\nway north along the Little Missouri. South, it ripped past Roswell, New\nMexico, and tore down the Pecos toward Texas. All the upper reaches of\nthe Missouri were standing puddles by now, and the Red River west of\nParis, Texas, had begun to run backward.\n\nSoon the Missouri began slowly slipping away westward over the slowly\nchurning land. Abandoning its bed, the river spread uncertainly across\nfarmland and prairie, becoming a sea of mud beneath the sharp new\ncliffs which rose in rending line, ever taller as the land continued to\nsink, almost from Canada to the Mexican border. There were virtually no\nfloods, in the usual sense. The water moved too slowly, spread itself\nwith no real direction or force. But the vast sheets of sluggish water\nand jelly-like mud formed death-traps for the countless refugees now\nstreaming east.\n\nPerhaps the North Platte disaster had been more than anyone could take.\n193 people had died in that one cave-in. Certainly by 7 October it had\nto be officially admitted that there was an exodus of epic proportion.\nNearly two million people were on the move, and the U. S. was faced\nwith a gigantic wave of refugees. Rails, roads and air-lanes were\njammed with terrified hordes who had left everything behind to crowd\neastward.\n\nAll through October hollow-eyed motorists flocked into Tulsa, Topeka,\nOmaha, Sioux Falls and Fargo. St. Louis was made distributing center\nfor emergency squads which flew everywhere with milk for babies and\ndog food for evacuating pets. Gasoline trucks boomed west to meet the\ndemand for gas, but once inside the \"zone of terror,\" as the newspapers\nnow called it, they found their route blocked by eastbound cars on the\nwrong side of the road. Shops left by their fleeing owners were looted\nby refugees from further west; an American Airlines plane was wrecked\nby a mob of would-be passengers in Bismarck, North Dakota. Federal and\nState troops were called out, but moving two million people was not to\nbe done in an orderly way.\n\nAnd still the landslip grew larger. The new cliffs gleamed in the\nautumn sunshine, growing higher as the land beneath them continued its\ninexorable descent.\n\nOn 21 October, at Lubbock, Texas, there was a noise variously described\nas a hollow roar, a shriek and a deep musical vibration like a church\nbell. It was simply the tortured rock of the substrata giving way. The\nsecond phase of the national disaster was beginning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe noise traveled due east at better than 85 miles per hour. In its\nwake the earth to the north \"just seemed to collapse on itself like\na punctured balloon,\" read one newspaper report. \"Like a cake that's\nfailed,\" said a Texarkana housewife who fortunately lived a block\n_south_ of Thayer Street, where the fissure raced through. There\nwas a sigh and a great cloud of dust, and Oklahoma subsided at the\nastounding rate of about six feet per hour.\n\nAt Biloxi, on the Gulf, there had been uneasy shufflings under foot all\nday. \"Not tremors, exactly,\" said the captain of a fishing boat which\nwas somehow to ride out the coming flood, \"but like as if the land\nwanted to be somewhere else.\"\n\nEveryone in doomed Biloxi would have done well to have been somewhere\nelse that evening. At approximately 8:30 p.m. the town shuddered,\nseemed to rise a little like the edge of a hall carpet caught in a\ndraft, and sank. So did the entire Mississippi and Alabama coast, at\nabout the same moment. The tidal wave which was to gouge the center\nfrom the U. S. marched on the land.\n\nFrom the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain to the Appalachicola River\nin Florida, the Gulf coast simply disappeared. Gulfport, Biloxi,\nMobile, Pensacola, Panama City: 200 miles of shoreline vanished, with\nover two and a half million people. An hour later a wall of water\nhad swept over every town from Dothan, Alabama, to Bogalusa on the\nLouisiana-Mississippi border.\n\n\"We must keep panic from our minds,\" said the Governor of Alabama in a\nradio message delivered from a hastily arranged all-station hookup. \"We\nof the gallant southland have faced and withstood invasion before.\"\nThen, as ominous creakings and groanings of the earth announced the\napproach of the tidal wave, he flew out of Montgomery half an hour\nbefore the town disappeared forever.\n\nOne head of the wave plunged north, eventually to spend itself in\nthe hills south of Birmingham. The main sweep followed the lowest\nland. Reaching west, it swallowed Vicksburg and nicked the corner of\nLouisiana. The whole of East Carroll Parish was scoured from the map.\n\nThe Mississippi River now ended at about Eudora, Arkansas, and minute\nby minute the advancing flood bit away miles of river bed, swelling\nnorth. Chicot, Jennie, Lake Village, Arkansas City, Snow Lake, Elaine,\nHelena and Memphis felt the tremors. The tormented city shuddered\nthrough the night. The earth continued its descent, eventually tipping\n2-1/2 degrees down to the west. The \"Memphis Tilt\" is today one of\nthe unique and charming characteristics of the gracious Old Town, but\nduring the night of panic Memphis residents were sure they were doomed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSouth and west the waters carved deeply into Arkansas and Oklahoma.\nBy morning it was plain that all of Arkansas was going under. Waves\nadvanced on Little Rock at almost 100 miles an hour, new crests\nforming, overtopping the wave's leading edge as towns, hills and the\nthirst of the soil temporarily broke the furious charge.\n\nWashington announced the official hope that the Ozarks would stop the\nwild gallop of the unleashed Gulf, for in northwest Arkansas the land\nrose to over 2,000 feet. But nothing could save Oklahoma. By noon the\nwater reached clutching fingers around Mt. Scott and Elk Mountain,\ndeluging Hobart and almost all of Greer County.\n\nDespite hopeful announcements that the wave was slowing, had virtually\nstopped after inundating Oklahoma City, was being swallowed up in the\ndesert near Amarillo, the wall of water continued its advance. For the\nland was still sinking, and the floods were constantly replenished from\nthe Gulf. Schwartzberg and his geologists advised the utmost haste in\nevacuating the entire area between Colorado and Missouri, from Texas to\nNorth Dakota.\n\nLubbock, Texas, went under. On a curling reflex the tidal wave blotted\nout Sweetwater and Big Spring. The Texas panhandle disappeared in one\ngreat swirl.\n\nWhirlpools opened. A great welter of smashed wood and human debris was\nsucked under, vomited up and pounded to pieces. Gulf-water crashed on\nthe cliffs of New Mexico and fell back on itself in foam. Would-be\nrescuers on the cliffs along what had been the west bank of the Pecos\nRiver afterwards recalled the hiss and scream like tearing silk as\nthe water broke furiously on the newly exposed rock. It was the most\nterrible sound they had ever heard.\n\n\"We couldn't hear any shouts, of course, not that far away and with all\nthe noise,\" said Dan Weaver, Mayor of Carlsbad. \"But we knew there\nwere people down there. When the water hit the cliffs, it was like a\ncollision between two solid bodies. We couldn't see for over an hour,\nbecause of the spray.\"\n\n_Salt spray._ The ocean had come to New Mexico.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cliffs proved to be the only effective barrier against the westward\nmarch of the water, which turned north, gouging out lumps of rock and\ntumbling down blocks of earth onto its own back. In places scoops of\ngranite came out like ice cream. The present fishing town of Rockport,\nColorado, is built on a harbor created in such a way.\n\nThe water had found its farthest westering. But still it poured north\nalong the line of the original Fault. Irresistible fingers closed on\nSterling, Colorado, on Sidney, Nebraska, on Hot Springs, South Dakota.\nThe entire tier of states settled, from south to north, down to its\neventual place of stability one thousand feet below the level of the\nnew sea.\n\nMemphis was by now a seaport. The Ozarks, islands in a mad sea, formed\nprecarious havens for half-drowned humanity. Waves bit off a corner of\nMissouri, flung themselves on Wichita. Topeka, Lawrence and Belleville\nwere the last Kansas towns to disappear. The Governor of Kansas went\ndown with his State.\n\nDaniel Bernd of Lincoln, Nebraska, was washed up half-drowned in a cove\nof the Wyoming cliffs, having been sucked from one end of vanished\nNebraska to the other. Similar hair-breadth escapes were recounted on\nradio and television.\n\nVirtually the only people saved out of the entire population of Pierre,\nSouth Dakota were the six members of the Creeth family. Plucky Timothy\nCreeth carried and dragged his aged parents to the loft of their barn\non the outskirts of town. His brother Geoffrey brought along the\nyounger children and what provisions they could find--\"Mostly a ham\nand about half a ton of vanilla cookies,\" he explained to his eventual\nrescuers. The barn, luckily collapsing in the vibrations as the waves\nbore down on them, became an ark in which they rode out the disaster.\n\n\"We must of played cards for four days straight,\" recalled genial\nMrs. Creeth when she afterwards appeared on a popular television\nspectacular. Her rural good-humor undamaged by an ordeal few women can\never have been called on to face, she added, \"We sure wondered why\nflushes never came out right. Jimanettly, we'd left the king of hearts\nbehind, in the rush!\"\n\nBut such lightheartedness and such happy endings were by no means\ntypical. The world could only watch aghast as the water raced north\nunder the shadow of the cliffs which occasionally crumbled, roaring,\ninto the roaring waves. Day by day the relentless rush swallowed what\nhad been dusty farmland, cities and towns.\n\nSome people were saved by the helicopters which flew mercy missions\njust ahead of the advancing waters. Some found safety in the peaks of\nwestern Nebraska and the Dakotas. But when the waters came to rest\nalong what is roughly the present shoreline of our inland sea, it was\nestimated that over fourteen million people had lost their lives.\n\nNo one could even estimate the damage to property; almost the entirety\nof eight states, and portions of twelve others, had simply vanished\nfrom the heart of the North American continent forever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was in such a cataclysmic birth that the now-peaceful Nebraska Sea\ncame to America.\n\nToday, nearly one hundred years after the unprecedented--and happily\nunrepeated--disaster, it is hard to remember the terror and despair of\nthose weeks in October and November, 1973. It is inconceivable to think\nof the United States without its beautiful and economically essential\ncurve of interior ocean. Two-thirds as long as the Mediterranean,\nit graduates from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico through the\nequally blue waves of the Mississippi Bight, becoming cooler and\ngreener north and west of the pleasant fishing isles of the Ozark\nArchipelago, finally shading into the gray-green chop of the Gulf of\nDakota.\n\nWhat would the United States have become without the 5600-mile\ncoastline of our inland sea? It is only within the last twenty years\nthat any but the topmost layer of water has cleared sufficiently\nto permit a really extensive fishing industry. Mud still held in\nsuspension by the restless waves will not precipitate fully even in our\nlifetimes. Even so, the commercial fisheries of Missouri and Wyoming\ncontribute no small part to the nation's economy.\n\nWho can imagine what the middle west must have been like before the\namelioration of climate brought about by the proximity of a warm sea?\nThe now-temperate state of Minnesota (to say nothing of the submerged\nDakotas) must have been Siberian. From contemporary accounts Missouri,\nour second California, was unbelievably muggy, almost uninhabitable\nduring the summer months. Our climate today, from Ohio and North\nCarolina to the rich fields of New Mexico and the orchards of Montana,\nis directly ameliorated by the marine heart of the continent.\n\nWho today could imagine the United States without the majestic\nsea-cliffs in stately parade from New Mexico to Montana? The beaches\nof Wyoming, the American Riviera, where fruit trees grow almost to the\nwater's edge? Or incredible Colorado, where the morning skier is the\nafternoon bather, thanks to the monorail connecting the highest peaks\nwith the glistening white beaches?\n\nOf course there have been losses to balance slightly these strong\ngains. The Mississippi was, before 1973, one of the great rivers of\nthe world. Taken together with its main tributary, the Missouri, it\nvied favorably with such giant systems as the Amazon and the Ganges.\nNow, ending as it does at Memphis and drawing its water chiefly from\nthe Appalachian Mountains, it is only a slight remnant of what it was.\nAnd though the Nebraska Sea today carries many times the tonnage of\nshipping in its ceaseless traffic, we have lost the old romance of\nriver shipping. We may only guess what it was like when we look upon\nthe Ohio and the truncated Mississippi.\n\nAnd transcontinental shipping is somewhat more difficult, with trucks\nand the freight-railroads obliged to take the sea-ferries across the\nNebraska Sea. We shall never know what the United States was like with\nits numerous coast-to-coast highways busy with trucks and private\ncars. Still, the ferry ride is certainly a welcome break after days of\ndriving, and for those who wish a glimpse of what it must have been\nlike, there is always the Cross-Canada Throughway and the magnificent\nU. S. Highway 73 looping north through Minnesota and passing through\nthe giant port of Alexis, North Dakota, shipping center for the wheat\nof Manitoba and crossroad of a nation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe political situation has long been a thorny problem. Only tattered\nremnants of the eight submerged states remained after the flood, but\nnone of them wanted to surrender its autonomy. The tiny fringe of\nKansas seemed, for a time, ready to merge with contiguous Missouri,\nbut following the lead of the Arkansas Forever faction, the remaining\npopulation decided to retain political integrity. This has resulted\nin the continuing anomaly of the seven \"fringe States\" represented\nin Congress by the usual two Senators each, though the largest of\nthem is barely the size of Connecticut and all are economically\nindistinguishable from their neighboring states.\n\nFortunately it was decided some years ago that Oklahoma, only one of\nthe eight to have completely disappeared, could not in any sense be\nconsidered to have a continuing political existence. So, though there\nare still families who proudly call themselves Oklahomans, and the\nOklahoma Oil Company continues to pump oil from its submerged real\nestate, the state has in fact disappeared from the American political\nscene.\n\nBut this is by now no more than a petty annoyance, to raise a smile\nwhen the talk gets around to the question of State's Rights. Not even\nthe tremendous price the country paid for its new sea--fourteen million\ndead, untold property destroyed--really offsets the asset we enjoy\ntoday. The heart of the continent, now open to the shipping of the\nworld, was once dry and land-locked, cut off from the bustle of trade\nand the ferment of world culture.\n\nIt would indeed seem odd to an American of the '50s or '60s of the last\ncentury to imagine sailors from the merchant fleets of every nation\nwalking the streets of Denver, fresh ashore at Newport, only fifteen\nmiles away. Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, Kansas City and Dallas as\nworld ports and great manufacturing centers. Utterly beyond their ken\nwould be Roswell, New Mexico; Benton, Wyoming; Westport, Missouri,\nand the other new ports of over a million inhabitants each which have\ndeveloped on the new harbors of the inland sea.\n\nUnimaginable too would have been the general growth of population\nin the states surrounding the new sea. As the water tables rose and\nmanufacturing and trade moved in to take advantage of the just-created\naxis of world communication, a population explosion was touched off of\nwhich we are only now seeing the diminution. This new westering is to\nbe ranked with the first surge of pioneers which created the American\nwest. But what a difference! Vacation paradises bloom, a new fishing\nindustry thrives; her water road is America's main artery of trade, and\nfleets of all the world sail ... where once the prairie schooner made\nits laborious and dusty way west!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Great Nebraska Sea, by Allan Danzig"}

The loss of solar heating has caused the Earth's atmosphere to freeze into thick layers of \"snow\". The boy's father had worked with a group of other scientists to construct a large shelter, but the earthquakes accompanying the disaster had destroyed it and killed the others. He managed to construct a smaller, makeshift shelter called the \"Nest\" for his family, where they maintain a breathable atmosphere by periodically retrieving pails of frozen oxygen to thaw over a fire. They have survived in this way for a number of years.\nAt the end, they are found by a search party from a large group of survivors at Los Alamos, where they are using nuclear power to provide heat and have begun using rockets to search for other survivors (radio being ineffective at long range without an ionosphere). They reveal that other groups of humans have survived at Argonne, Brookhaven, and Harwell nuclear research facilities as well as in Tanna Tuva, and that plans are being made to establish uranium-mining colonies at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo region.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK A PAIL OF AIR ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             A Pail of Air\n\n                            By FRITZ LEIBER\n\n                      Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                 Galaxy Science Fiction December 1951.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n                The dark star passed, bringing with it\n                eternal night and turning history into\n                incredible myth in a single generation!\n\n\nPa had sent me out to get an extra pail of air. I'd just about scooped\nit full and most of the warmth had leaked from my fingers when I saw\nthe thing.\n\nYou know, at first I thought it was a young lady. Yes, a beautiful\nyoung lady's face all glowing in the dark and looking at me from the\nfifth floor of the opposite apartment, which hereabouts is the floor\njust above the white blanket of frozen air. I'd never seen a live young\nlady before, except in the old magazines--Sis is just a kid and Ma is\npretty sick and miserable--and it gave me such a start that I dropped\nthe pail. Who wouldn't, knowing everyone on Earth was dead except Pa\nand Ma and Sis and you?\n\nEven at that, I don't suppose I should have been surprised. We all\nsee things now and then. Ma has some pretty bad ones, to judge from\nthe way she bugs her eyes at nothing and just screams and screams and\nhuddles back against the blankets hanging around the Nest. Pa says it\nis natural we should react like that sometimes.\n\nWhen I'd recovered the pail and could look again at the opposite\napartment, I got an idea of what Ma might be feeling at those times,\nfor I saw it wasn't a young lady at all but simply a light--a tiny\nlight that moved stealthily from window to window, just as if one\nof the cruel little stars had come down out of the airless sky to\ninvestigate why the Earth had gone away from the Sun, and maybe to hunt\ndown something to torment or terrify, now that the Earth didn't have\nthe Sun's protection.\n\nI tell you, the thought of it gave me the creeps. I just stood there\nshaking, and almost froze my feet and did frost my helmet so solid on\nthe inside that I couldn't have seen the light even if it had come out\nof one of the windows to get me. Then I had the wit to go back inside.\n\nPretty soon I was feeling my familiar way through the thirty or so\nblankets and rugs Pa has got hung around to slow down the escape of\nair from the Nest, and I wasn't quite so scared. I began to hear the\ntick-ticking of the clocks in the Nest and knew I was getting back\ninto air, because there's no sound outside in the vacuum, of course.\nBut my mind was still crawly and uneasy as I pushed through the last\nblankets--Pa's got them faced with aluminum foil to hold in the\nheat--and came into the Nest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLet me tell you about the Nest. It's low and snug, just room for the\nfour of us and our things. The floor is covered with thick woolly\nrugs. Three of the sides are blankets, and the blankets roofing it\ntouch Pa's head. He tells me it's inside a much bigger room, but I've\nnever seen the real walls or ceiling.\n\nAgainst one of the blanket-walls is a big set of shelves, with tools\nand books and other stuff, and on top of it a whole row of clocks. Pa's\nvery fussy about keeping them wound. He says we must never forget time,\nand without a sun or moon, that would be easy to do.\n\nThe fourth wall has blankets all over except around the fireplace, in\nwhich there is a fire that must never go out. It keeps us from freezing\nand does a lot more besides. One of us must always watch it. Some of\nthe clocks are alarm and we can use them to remind us. In the early\ndays there was only Ma to take turns with Pa--I think of that when she\ngets difficult--but now there's me to help, and Sis too.\n\nIt's Pa who is the chief guardian of the fire, though. I always think\nof him that way: a tall man sitting cross-legged, frowning anxiously\nat the fire, his lined face golden in its light, and every so often\ncarefully placing on it a piece of coal from the big heap beside it. Pa\ntells me there used to be guardians of the fire sometimes in the very\nold days--vestal virgins, he calls them--although there was unfrozen\nair all around then and you didn't really need one.\n\nHe was sitting just that way now, though he got up quick to take the\npail from me and bawl me out for loitering--he'd spotted my frozen\nhelmet right off. That roused Ma and she joined in picking on me. She's\nalways trying to get the load off her feelings, Pa explains. He shut\nher up pretty fast. Sis let off a couple of silly squeals too.\n\nPa handled the pail of air in a twist of cloth. Now that it was inside\nthe Nest, you could really feel its coldness. It just seemed to suck\nthe heat out of everything. Even the flames cringed away from it as Pa\nput it down close by the fire.\n\nYet it's that glimmery white stuff in the pail that keeps us alive.\nIt slowly melts and vanishes and refreshes the Nest and feeds the\nfire. The blankets keep it from escaping too fast. Pa'd like to seal\nthe whole place, but he can't--building's too earthquake-twisted, and\nbesides he has to leave the chimney open for smoke.\n\nPa says air is tiny molecules that fly away like a flash if there isn't\nsomething to stop them. We have to watch sharp not to let the air run\nlow. Pa always keeps a big reserve supply of it in buckets behind\nthe first blankets, along with extra coal and cans of food and other\nthings, such as pails of snow to melt for water. We have to go way down\nto the bottom floor for that stuff, which is a mean trip, and get it\nthrough a door to outside.\n\nYou see, when the Earth got cold, all the water in the air froze first\nand made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere, and then down on\ntop of that dropped the crystals of frozen air, making another white\nblanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe.\n\nOf course, all the parts of the air didn't freeze and snow down at the\nsame time.\n\nFirst to drop out was the carbon dioxide--when you're shoveling for\nwater, you have to make sure you don't go too high and get any of that\nstuff mixed in, for it would put you to sleep, maybe for good, and make\nthe fire go out. Next there's the nitrogen, which doesn't count one way\nor the other, though it's the biggest part of the blanket. On top of\nthat and easy to get at, which is lucky for us, there's the oxygen that\nkeeps us alive. Pa says we live better than kings ever did, breathing\npure oxygen, but we're used to it and don't notice. Finally, at the\nvery top, there's a slick of liquid helium, which is funny stuff.\nAll of these gases in neat separate layers. Like a pussy caffay, Pa\nlaughingly says, whatever that is.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was busting to tell them all about what I'd seen, and so as soon as\nI'd ducked out of my helmet and while I was still climbing out of my\nsuit, I cut loose. Right away Ma got nervous and began making eyes at\nthe entry-slit in the blankets and wringing her hands together--the\nhand where she'd lost three fingers from frostbite inside the good one,\nas usual. I could tell that Pa was annoyed at me scaring her and wanted\nto explain it all away quickly, yet could see I wasn't fooling.\n\n\"And you watched this light for some time, son?\" he asked when I\nfinished.\n\nI hadn't said anything about first thinking it was a young lady's face.\nSomehow that part embarrassed me.\n\n\"Long enough for it to pass five windows and go to the next floor.\"\n\n\"And it didn't look like stray electricity or crawling liquid or\nstarlight focused by a growing crystal, or anything like that?\"\n\nHe wasn't just making up those ideas. Odd things happen in a world\nthat's about as cold as can be, and just when you think matter\nwould be frozen dead, it takes on a strange new life. A slimy stuff\ncomes crawling toward the Nest, just like an animal snuffing for\nheat--that's the liquid helium. And once, when I was little, a bolt of\nlightning--not even Pa could figure where it came from--hit the nearby\nsteeple and crawled up and down it for weeks, until the glow finally\ndied.\n\n\"Not like anything I ever saw,\" I told him.\n\nHe stood for a moment frowning. Then, \"I'll go out with you, and you\nshow it to me,\" he said.\n\nMa raised a howl at the idea of being left alone, and Sis joined\nin, too, but Pa quieted them. We started climbing into our outside\nclothes--mine had been warming by the fire. Pa made them. They have\nplastic headpieces that were once big double-duty transparent food\ncans, but they keep heat and air in and can replace the air for a\nlittle while, long enough for our trips for water and coal and food and\nso on.\n\nMa started moaning again, \"I've always known there was something\noutside there, waiting to get us. I've felt it for years--something\nthat's part of the cold and hates all warmth and wants to destroy the\nNest. It's been watching us all this time, and now it's coming after\nus. It'll get you and then come for me. Don't go, Harry!\"\n\nPa had everything on but his helmet. He knelt by the fireplace and\nreached in and shook the long metal rod that goes up the chimney and\nknocks off the ice that keeps trying to clog it. Once a week he goes up\non the roof to check if it's working all right. That's our worst trip\nand Pa won't let me make it alone.\n\n\"Sis,\" Pa said quietly, \"come watch the fire. Keep an eye on the air,\ntoo. If it gets low or doesn't seem to be boiling fast enough, fetch\nanother bucket from behind the blanket. But mind your hands. Use the\ncloth to pick up the bucket.\"\n\nSis quit helping Ma be frightened and came over and did as she was\ntold. Ma quieted down pretty suddenly, though her eyes were still kind\nof wild as she watched Pa fix on his helmet tight and pick up a pail\nand the two of us go out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPa led the way and I took hold of his belt. It's a funny thing, I'm not\nafraid to go by myself, but when Pa's along I always want to hold on to\nhim. Habit, I guess, and then there's no denying that this time I was a\nbit scared.\n\nYou see, it's this way. We know that everything is dead out there. Pa\nheard the last radio voices fade away years ago, and had seen some of\nthe last folks die who weren't as lucky or well-protected as us. So we\nknew that if there was something groping around out there, it couldn't\nbe anything human or friendly.\n\nBesides that, there's a feeling that comes with it always being night,\n_cold_ night. Pa says there used to be some of that feeling even in the\nold days, but then every morning the Sun would come and chase it away.\nI have to take his word for that, not ever remembering the Sun as being\nanything more than a big star. You see, I hadn't been born when the\ndark star snatched us away from the Sun, and by now it's dragged us out\nbeyond the orbit of the planet Pluto, Pa says, and taking us farther\nout all the time.\n\nI found myself wondering whether there mightn't be something on the\ndark star that wanted us, and if that was why it had captured the\nEarth. Just then we came to the end of the corridor and I followed Pa\nout on the balcony.\n\nI don't know what the city looked like in the old days, but now it's\nbeautiful. The starlight lets you see it pretty well--there's quite a\nbit of light in those steady points speckling the blackness above. (Pa\nsays the stars used to twinkle once, but that was because there was\nair.) We are on a hill and the shimmery plain drops away from us and\nthen flattens out, cut up into neat squares by the troughs that used to\nbe streets. I sometimes make my mashed potatoes look like it, before I\npour on the gravy.\n\nSome taller buildings push up out of the feathery plain, topped\nby rounded caps of air crystals, like the fur hood Ma wears, only\nwhiter. On those buildings you can see the darker squares of windows,\nunderlined by white dashes of air crystals. Some of them are on a\nslant, for many of the buildings are pretty badly twisted by the quakes\nand all the rest that happened when the dark star captured the Earth.\n\nHere and there a few icicles hang, water icicles from the first days\nof the cold, other icicles of frozen air that melted on the roofs and\ndripped and froze again. Sometimes one of those icicles will catch the\nlight of a star and send it to you so brightly you think the star has\nswooped into the city. That was one of the things Pa had been thinking\nof when I told him about the light, but I had thought of it myself\nfirst and known it wasn't so.\n\nHe touched his helmet to mine so we could talk easier and he asked me\nto point out the windows to him. But there wasn't any light moving\naround inside them now, or anywhere else. To my surprise, Pa didn't\nbawl me out and tell me I'd been seeing things. He looked all around\nquite a while after filling his pail, and just as we were going inside\nhe whipped around without warning, as if to take some peeping thing\noff guard.\n\nI could feel it, too. The old peace was gone. There was something\nlurking out there, watching, waiting, getting ready.\n\nInside, he said to me, touching helmets, \"If you see something like\nthat again, son, don't tell the others. Your Ma's sort of nervous these\ndays and we owe her all the feeling of safety we can give her. Once--it\nwas when your sister was born--I was ready to give up and die, but your\nMother kept me trying. Another time she kept the fire going a whole\nweek all by herself when I was sick. Nursed me and took care of the two\nof you, too.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You know that game we sometimes play, sitting in a square in the Nest,\ntossing a ball around? Courage is like a ball, son. A person can hold\nit only so long, and then he's got to toss it to someone else. When\nit's tossed your way, you've got to catch it and hold it tight--and\nhope there'll be someone else to toss it to when you get tired of being\nbrave.\"\n\nHis talking to me that way made me feel grown-up and good. But it\ndidn't wipe away the thing outside from the back of my mind--or the\nfact that Pa took it seriously.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt's hard to hide your feelings about such a thing. When we got back in\nthe Nest and took off our outside clothes, Pa laughed about it all and\ntold them it was nothing and kidded me for having such an imagination,\nbut his words fell flat. He didn't convince Ma and Sis any more than\nhe did me. It looked for a minute like we were all fumbling the\ncourage-ball. Something had to be done, and almost before I knew what\nI was going to say, I heard myself asking Pa to tell us about the old\ndays, and how it all happened.\n\nHe sometimes doesn't mind telling that story, and Sis and I sure like\nto listen to it, and he got my idea. So we were all settled around the\nfire in a wink, and Ma pushed up some cans to thaw for supper, and Pa\nbegan. Before he did, though, I noticed him casually get a hammer from\nthe shelf and lay it down beside him.\n\nIt was the same old story as always--I think I could recite the main\nthread of it in my sleep--though Pa always puts in a new detail or two\nand keeps improving it in spots.\n\nHe told us how the Earth had been swinging around the Sun ever so\nsteady and warm, and the people on it fixing to make money and wars and\nhave a good time and get power and treat each other right or wrong,\nwhen without warning there comes charging out of space this dead star,\nthis burned out sun, and upsets everything.\n\nYou know, I find it hard to believe in the way those people felt,\nany more than I can believe in the swarming number of them. Imagine\npeople getting ready for the horrible sort of war they were cooking up.\nWanting it even, or at least wishing it were over so as to end their\nnervousness. As if all folks didn't have to hang together and pool\nevery bit of warmth just to keep alive. And how can they have hoped to\nend danger, any more than we can hope to end the cold?\n\nSometimes I think Pa exaggerates and makes things out too black. He's\ncross with us once in a while and was probably cross with all those\nfolks. Still, some of the things I read in the old magazines sound\npretty wild. He may be right.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dark star, as Pa went on telling it, rushed in pretty fast and\nthere wasn't much time to get ready. At the beginning they tried\nto keep it a secret from most people, but then the truth came out,\nwhat with the earthquakes and floods--imagine, oceans of _unfrozen_\nwater!--and people seeing stars blotted out by something on a clear\nnight. First off they thought it would hit the Sun, and then they\nthought it would hit the Earth. There was even the start of a rush to\nget to a place called China, because people thought the star would hit\non the other side. But then they found it wasn't going to hit either\nside, but was going to come very close to the Earth.\n\nMost of the other planets were on the other side of the Sun and didn't\nget involved. The Sun and the newcomer fought over the Earth for a\nlittle while--pulling it this way and that, like two dogs growling\nover a bone, Pa described it this time--and then the newcomer won and\ncarried us off. The Sun got a consolation prize, though. At the last\nminute he managed to hold on to the Moon.\n\nThat was the time of the monster earthquakes and floods, twenty times\nworse than anything before. It was also the time of the Big Jerk, as Pa\ncalls it, when all Earth got yanked suddenly, just as Pa has done to\nme once or twice, grabbing me by the collar to do it, when I've been\nsitting too far from the fire.\n\nYou see, the dark star was going through space faster than the Sun, and\nin the opposite direction, and it had to wrench the world considerably\nin order to take it away.\n\nThe Big Jerk didn't last long. It was over as soon as the Earth\nwas settled down in its new orbit around the dark star. But it was\npretty terrible while it lasted. Pa says that all sorts of cliffs and\nbuildings toppled, oceans slopped over, swamps and sandy deserts gave\ngreat sliding surges that buried nearby lands. Earth was almost jerked\nout of its atmosphere blanket and the air got so thin in spots that\npeople keeled over and fainted--though of course, at the same time,\nthey were getting knocked down by the Big Jerk and maybe their bones\nbroke or skulls cracked.\n\nWe've often asked Pa how people acted during that time, whether they\nwere scared or brave or crazy or stunned, or all four, but he's sort of\nleery of the subject, and he was again tonight. He says he was mostly\ntoo busy to notice.\n\nYou see, Pa and some scientist friends of his had figured out part of\nwhat was going to happen--they'd known we'd get captured and our air\nwould freeze--and they'd been working like mad to fix up a place with\nairtight walls and doors, and insulation against the cold, and big\nsupplies of food and fuel and water and bottled air. But the place\ngot smashed in the last earthquakes and all Pa's friends were killed\nthen and in the Big Jerk. So he had to start over and throw the Nest\ntogether quick without any advantages, just using any stuff he could\nlay his hands on.\n\nI guess he's telling pretty much the truth when he says he didn't have\nany time to keep an eye on how other folks behaved, either then or\nin the Big Freeze that followed--followed very quick, you know, both\nbecause the dark star was pulling us away very fast and because Earth's\nrotation had been slowed in the tug-of-war, so that the nights were ten\nold nights long.\n\nStill, I've got an idea of some of the things that happened from the\nfrozen folk I've seen, a few of them in other rooms in our building,\nothers clustered around the furnaces in the basements where we go for\ncoal.\n\nIn one of the rooms, an old man sits stiff in a chair, with an arm and\na leg in splints. In another, a man and woman are huddled together in\na bed with heaps of covers over them. You can just see their heads\npeeking out, close together. And in another a beautiful young lady is\nsitting with a pile of wraps huddled around her, looking hopefully\ntoward the door, as if waiting for someone who never came back with\nwarmth and food. They're all still and stiff as statues, of course, but\njust like life.\n\nPa showed them to me once in quick winks of his flashlight, when\nhe still had a fair supply of batteries and could afford to waste\na little light. They scared me pretty bad and made my heart pound,\nespecially the young lady.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow, with Pa telling his story for the umpteenth time to take our minds\noff another scare, I got to thinking of the frozen folk again. All of a\nsudden I got an idea that scared me worse than anything yet. You see,\nI'd just remembered the face I'd thought I'd seen in the window. I'd\nforgotten about that on account of trying to hide it from the others.\n\nWhat, I asked myself, if the frozen folk were coming to life? What\nif they were like the liquid helium that got a new lease on life\nand started crawling toward the heat just when you thought its\nmolecules ought to freeze solid forever? Or like the electricity that\nmoves endlessly when it's just about as cold as that? What if the\never-growing cold, with the temperature creeping down the last few\ndegrees to the last zero, had mysteriously wakened the frozen folk to\nlife--not warm-blooded life, but something icy and horrible?\n\nThat was a worse idea than the one about something coming down from the\ndark star to get us.\n\nOr maybe, I thought, both ideas might be true. Something coming down\nfrom the dark star and making the frozen folk move, using them to do\nits work. That would fit with both things I'd seen--the beautiful young\nlady and the moving, starlike light.\n\nThe frozen folk with minds from the dark star behind their unwinking\neyes, creeping, crawling, snuffing their way, following the heat to the\nNest.\n\nI tell you, that thought gave me a very bad turn and I wanted very\nbadly to tell the others my fears, but I remembered what Pa had said\nand clenched my teeth and didn't speak.\n\nWe were all sitting very still. Even the fire was burning silently.\nThere was just the sound of Pa's voice and the clocks.\n\nAnd then, from beyond the blankets, I thought I heard a tiny noise. My\nskin tightened all over me.\n\nPa was telling about the early years in the Nest and had come to the\nplace where he philosophizes.\n\n\"So I asked myself then,\" he said, \"what's the use of going on? What's\nthe use of dragging it out for a few years? Why prolong a doomed\nexistence of hard work and cold and loneliness? The human race is done.\nThe Earth is done. Why not give up, I asked myself--and all of a sudden\nI got the answer.\"\n\nAgain I heard the noise, louder this time, a kind of uncertain,\nshuffling tread, coming closer. I couldn't breathe.\n\n\"Life's always been a business of working hard and fighting the cold,\"\nPa was saying. \"The earth's always been a lonely place, millions of\nmiles from the next planet. And no matter how long the human race might\nhave lived, the end would have come some night. Those things don't\nmatter. What matters is that life is good. It has a lovely texture,\nlike some rich cloth or fur, or the petals of flowers--you've seen\npictures of those, but I can't describe how they feel--or the fire's\nglow. It makes everything else worth while. And that's as true for the\nlast man as the first.\"\n\nAnd still the steps kept shuffling closer. It seemed to me that the\ninmost blanket trembled and bulged a little. Just as if they were\nburned into my imagination, I kept seeing those peering, frozen eyes.\n\n\"So right then and there,\" Pa went on, and now I could tell that he\nheard the steps, too, and was talking loud so we maybe wouldn't hear\nthem, \"right then and there I told myself that I was going on as if\nwe had all eternity ahead of us. I'd have children and teach them all\nI could. I'd get them to read books. I'd plan for the future, try to\nenlarge and seal the Nest. I'd do what I could to keep everything\nbeautiful and growing. I'd keep alive my feeling of wonder even at the\ncold and the dark and the distant stars.\"\n\nBut then the blanket actually did move and lift. And there was a bright\nlight somewhere behind it. Pa's voice stopped and his eyes turned to\nthe widening slit and his hand went out until it touched and gripped\nthe handle of the hammer beside him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn through the blanket stepped the beautiful young lady. She stood\nthere looking at us the strangest way, and she carried something\nbright and unwinking in her hand. And two other faces peered over her\nshoulders--men's faces, white and staring.\n\nWell, my heart couldn't have been stopped for more than four or five\nbeats before I realized she was wearing a suit and helmet like Pa's\nhomemade ones, only fancier, and that the men were, too--and that the\nfrozen folk certainly wouldn't be wearing those. Also, I noticed that\nthe bright thing in her hand was just a kind of flashlight.\n\nThe silence kept on while I swallowed hard a couple of times, and after\nthat there was all sorts of jabbering and commotion.\n\nThey were simply people, you see. We hadn't been the only ones to\nsurvive; we'd just thought so, for natural enough reasons. These three\npeople had survived, and quite a few others with them. And when we\nfound out _how_ they'd survived, Pa let out the biggest whoop of joy.\n\nThey were from Los Alamos and they were getting their heat and power\nfrom atomic energy. Just using the uranium and plutonium intended\nfor bombs, they had enough to go on for thousands of years. They had\na regular little airtight city, with air-locks and all. They even\ngenerated electric light and grew plants and animals by it. (At this Pa\nlet out a second whoop, waking Ma from her faint.)\n\nBut if we were flabbergasted at them, they were double-flabbergasted at\nus.\n\nOne of the men kept saying, \"But it's impossible, I tell you. You\ncan't maintain an air supply without hermetic sealing. It's simply\nimpossible.\"\n\nThat was after he had got his helmet off and was using our air.\nMeanwhile, the young lady kept looking around at us as if we were\nsaints, and telling us we'd done something amazing, and suddenly she\nbroke down and cried.\n\nThey'd been scouting around for survivors, but they never expected to\nfind any in a place like this. They had rocket ships at Los Alamos and\nplenty of chemical fuel. As for liquid oxygen, all you had to do was\ngo out and shovel the air blanket at the top _level_. So after they'd\ngot things going smoothly at Los Alamos, which had taken years, they'd\ndecided to make some trips to likely places where there might be other\nsurvivors. No good trying long-distance radio signals, of course, since\nthere was no atmosphere to carry them around the curve of the Earth.\n\nWell, they'd found other colonies at Argonne and Brookhaven and way\naround the world at Harwell and Tanna Tuva. And now they'd been giving\nour city a look, not really expecting to find anything. But they had an\ninstrument that noticed the faintest heat waves and it had told them\nthere was something warm down here, so they'd landed to investigate.\nOf course we hadn't heard them land, since there was no air to carry\nthe sound, and they'd had to investigate around quite a while before\nfinding us. Their instruments had given them a wrong steer and they'd\nwasted some time in the building across the street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy now, all five adults were talking like sixty. Pa was demonstrating\nto the men how he worked the fire and got rid of the ice in the chimney\nand all that. Ma had perked up wonderfully and was showing the young\nlady her cooking and sewing stuff, and even asking about how the women\ndressed at Los Alamos. The strangers marveled at everything and praised\nit to the skies. I could tell from the way they wrinkled their noses\nthat they found the Nest a bit smelly, but they never mentioned that at\nall and just asked bushels of questions.\n\nIn fact, there was so much talking and excitement that Pa forgot about\nthings, and it wasn't until they were all getting groggy that he looked\nand found the air had all boiled away in the pail. He got another\nbucket of air quick from behind the blankets. Of course that started\nthem all laughing and jabbering again. The newcomers even got a little\ndrunk. They weren't used to so much oxygen.\n\nFunny thing, though--I didn't do much talking at all and Sis hung on\nto Ma all the time and hid her face when anybody looked at her. I felt\npretty uncomfortable and disturbed myself, even about the young lady.\nGlimpsing her outside there, I'd had all sorts of mushy thoughts, but\nnow I was just embarrassed and scared of her, even though she tried to\nbe nice as anything to me.\n\nI sort of wished they'd all quit crowding the Nest and let us be alone\nand get our feelings straightened out.\n\nAnd when the newcomers began to talk about our all going to Los Alamos,\nas if that were taken for granted, I could see that something of the\nsame feeling struck Pa and Ma, too. Pa got very silent all of a sudden\nand Ma kept telling the young lady, \"But I wouldn't know how to act\nthere and I haven't any clothes.\"\n\nThe strangers were puzzled like anything at first, but then they got\nthe idea. As Pa kept saying, \"It just doesn't seem right to let this\nfire go out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, the strangers are gone, but they're coming back. It hasn't been\ndecided yet just what will happen. Maybe the Nest will be kept up as\nwhat one of the strangers called a \"survival school.\" Or maybe we will\njoin the pioneers who are going to try to establish a new colony at the\nuranium mines at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo.\n\nOf course, now that the strangers are gone, I've been thinking a\nlot about Los Alamos and those other tremendous colonies. I have a\nhankering to see them for myself.\n\nYou ask me, Pa wants to see them, too. He's been getting pretty\nthoughtful, watching Ma and Sis perk up.\n\n\"It's different, now that we know others are alive,\" he explains to me.\n\"Your mother doesn't feel so hopeless any more. Neither do I, for that\nmatter, not having to carry the whole responsibility for keeping the\nhuman race going, so to speak. It scares a person.\"\n\nI looked around at the blanket walls and the fire and the pails of air\nboiling away and Ma and Sis sleeping in the warmth and the flickering\nlight.\n\n\"It's not going to be easy to leave the Nest,\" I said, wanting to cry,\nkind of. \"It's so small and there's just the four of us. I get scared\nat the idea of big places and a lot of strangers.\"\n\nHe nodded and put another piece of coal on the fire. Then he looked at\nthe little pile and grinned suddenly and put a couple of handfuls on,\njust as if it was one of our birthdays or Christmas.\n\n\"You'll quickly get over that feeling son,\" he said. \"The trouble with\nthe world was that it kept getting smaller and smaller, till it ended\nwith just the Nest. Now it'll be good to have a real huge world again,\nthe way it was in the beginning.\"\n\nI guess he's right. You think the beautiful young lady will wait for me\ntill I grow up? I'll be twenty in only ten years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Pail of Air, by Fritz Leiber"}

TOD\n\n\nI have made many books about well-behaved people. Now, for a change, I\nam going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy\nBrock and Mr. Tod.\n\nNobody could call Mr. Tod \"nice.\" The rabbits could not bear him; they\ncould smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had\nfoxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.\n\n\n\nOne day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to\nthe family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard\nwillow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.\n\nIn winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth\namongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.\n\nHe had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.\n\nThe houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved _out_; because\nsometimes Tommy Brock moved _in_; (without asking leave).\n\nTommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he\ngrinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp\nnests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging\nthings up.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always\nwent to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in, was\ngenerally Mr. Tod's.\n\nNow Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very\nlittle young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He\nwas friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked\notters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.\n\nOld Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years. He sat in the spring sunshine\noutside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.\n\nHe lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who\nhad a young family. Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that\nafternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes\nand kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow\nburrow, separate from the main rabbit hole. To tell the truth--old Mr.\nBouncer had forgotten them.\n\nHe sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was\npassing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for\ndigging, and some mole traps. He complained bitterly about the\nscarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them. And\nthe otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in\nwinter--\"I have not had a good square meal for a fortnight, I am living\non pig-nuts. I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!\" said\nTommy Brock.\n\n\n\nIt was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy\nBrock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.\n\nSo old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to\ntaste a slice of seed-cake and \"a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip\nwine.\" Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.\n\n\n\nThen old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage\nleaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more\nthan ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and\nlaughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.\n\nAnd Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the\ncabbage smoke....\n\nWhen Flopsy and Benjamin came back--old Mr. Bouncer woke up. Tommy Brock\nand all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared!\n\nMr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the\nrabbit hole. But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were\nround heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her\nears, and slapped him.\n\n\n\nBenjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.\n\nThere was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot-mark\nand gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had\nrooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole\nfor dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the\nway. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps\nshowed plainly in the mud.\n\nThe path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared;\nthere were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths--but the smell\nthat made Benjamin stop, was _not_ the smell of flowers!\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Tod's stick house was before him and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home.\nThere was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it--there was smoke\ncoming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.\n\nBenjamin Bunny sat up, staring; his whiskers twitched. Inside the stick\nhouse somebody dropped a plate, and said something. Benjamin stamped his\nfoot, and bolted.\n\nHe never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently\nTommy Brock had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall, there\nwere again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught\non a briar.\n\nBenjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow. He found another mole\ntrap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock. It was\ngetting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy\nthe evening air. One of them in a blue coat by himself, was busily\nhunting for dandelions.--\"Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!\"\nshouted Benjamin Bunny.\n\nThe blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears--\n\n\n\n\"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat\nFerret?\"\n\n\"No, no, no! He's bagged my family--Tommy Brock--in a sack--have you\nseen him?\"\n\n\"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?\"\n\n\"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way?\nPlease tell me quick!\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since ... he said they were _caterpillars_; I\ndid think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars.\"\n\n\"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?\"\n\n\"He had a sack with something 'live in it; I watched him set a mole\ntrap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning.\"\nBenjamin did so.\n\n\n\n\"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his\nyears;\" said Peter reflectively, \"but there are two hopeful\ncircumstances. Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had\nrefreshment. He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast.\"\n\"Which way?\" \"Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself. I know very well which\nway. Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to Mr.\nTod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks. I partly know, because he\noffered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's; he said he would be\npassing.\" (Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on\nthe hill).\n\nPeter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was\nall of a twitter. They crossed several fields and began to climb the\nhill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen. He seemed to\nhave put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.\n\n\"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent. What a\nnasty person!\" said Peter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Half way\nup, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half-grown\nlittle rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.\n\nCottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether\nher husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice\nwhile she watched him.\n\nHe had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with\nlaughing.--\"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!\"\nsaid Benjamin Bunny.\n\nThey climbed up and up;--\"He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping\nout of the hole.\" \"They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their\nneighbours. Come on, Cousin Benjamin!\"\n\nWhen they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went\ncautiously. The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a\ncrag--Mr. Tod had made one of his homes. It was at the top of a steep\nbank; the rocks and bushes overhung it. The rabbits crept up carefully,\nlistening and peeping.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown\npig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.\n\nThe setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the\nkitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the\nrabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.\n\nBenjamin sighed with relief.\n\n\n\nBut there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him\nshudder. There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and\na large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.\n\nAt the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate,\na tumbler, a knife and fork, salt-cellar, mustard and a chair--in short,\npreparations for one person's supper.\n\n\n\nNo person was to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty\nand silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin flattened their\nnoses against the window, and stared into the dusk.\n\nThen they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house. It\nwas damp and smelly, and overgrown with thorns and briars.\n\nThe rabbits shivered in their shoes.\n\n\"Oh my poor rabbit babies! What a dreadful place; I shall never see them\nagain!\" sighed Benjamin.\n\nThey crept up to the bedroom window. It was closed and bolted like the\nkitchen. But there were signs that this window had been recently open;\nthe cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon\nthe window-sill.\n\nThe room inside was so dark, that at first they could make out nothing;\nbut they could hear a noise--a slow deep regular snoring grunt. And as\ntheir eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that\nsomebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.--\"He\nhas gone to bed in his boots,\" whispered Peter.\n\n\n\nBenjamin, who was all of a twitter, pulled Peter off the window-sill.\n\nTommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed.\nNothing could be seen of the young family.\n\nThe sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood. There were many\nunpleasant things lying about, that had much better have been buried;\nrabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. It was a\nshocking place, and very dark.\n\nThey went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move\nthe bolt of the kitchen window. They tried to push up a rusty nail\nbetween the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a\nlight.\n\n\n\nThey sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.\n\nIn half an hour the moon rose over the wood. It shone full and clear and\ncold, upon the house amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window.\nBut alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!\n\nThe moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a\npath of brightness across the dirty floor.\n\nThe light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen\nfireplace--a little iron door belonging to a brick oven, of that\nold-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.\n\nAnd presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that\nwhenever they shook the window--the little door opposite shook in\nanswer. The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!\n\n\n\nBenjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy\nBrock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.\n\nBut there really was not very much comfort in the discovery. They could\nnot open the window; and although the young family was alive--the little\nrabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not\nold enough to crawl.\n\nAfter much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel. They\nbegan to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank. They hoped that they\nmight be able to work between the large stones under the house; the\nkitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was\nmade of earth or flags.\n\n\n\nThey dug and dug for hours. They could not tunnel straight on account of\nstones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor.\nBenjamin was on his back, scratching upwards. Peter's claws were worn\ndown; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. He called out that\nit was morning--sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down\nbelow in the woods.\n\nBenjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel, shaking the sand from his\nears; he cleaned his face with his paws. Every minute the sun shone\nwarmer on the top of the hill. In the valley there was a sea of white\nmist, with golden tops of trees showing through.\n\nAgain from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of\na jay--followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!\n\nThen those two rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most\nfoolish thing that they could have done. They rushed into their short\nnew tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's\nkitchen floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of\ntempers. First he had been upset by breaking the plate. It was his own\nfault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had\nbelonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod. Then the midges had been\nvery bad. And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it\nhad contained only five eggs, two of them addled. Mr. Tod had had an\nunsatisfactory night.\n\n\n\nAs usual, when out of humour, he determined to move house. First he\ntried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a\ndead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.\n\nHe made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing\nunmistakable marks of badger. No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly\nas Tommy Brock.\n\n\n\nMr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where\nTommy Brock had gone to. He was further annoyed by the jay bird which\nfollowed him persistently. It flew from tree to tree and scolded,\nwarning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was\ncoming up the plantation. Once when it flew screaming over his head--Mr.\nTod snapped at it, and barked.\n\nHe approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key. He\nsniffed and his whiskers bristled. The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod\nhad his doubts whether it was empty. He turned the rusty key in the\nlock; the rabbits below could hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door\ncautiously and went in.\n\n\n\nThe sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod\nfurious. There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his\nknife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his table-cloth that he\nhad left folded up in the dresser--all set out for supper (or\nbreakfast)--without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.\n\nThere was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately\noverpowered all smell of rabbit.\n\nBut what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise--a deep slow regular\nsnoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.\n\nHe peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. Then he\nturned and came out of the house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled and\nhis coat-collar stood on end with rage.\n\n\n\nFor the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the\nhouse, and retreating hurriedly out again. By degrees he ventured\nfurther in--right into the bedroom. When he was outside the house, he\nscratched up the earth with fury. But when he was inside--he did not\nlike the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.\n\nHe was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear.\nHe snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.\n\nMr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom. Twice he brought in his\nwalking-stick, and once he brought in the coal-scuttle. But he thought\nbetter of it, and took them away.\n\n\n\nWhen he came back after removing the coal-scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying\na little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep. He was an\nincurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he\nwas simply too lazy and comfortable to move.\n\nMr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line. He\nstood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the\nsnores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.\n\nMr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window. It\ncreaked; he turned round with a jump. Tommy Brock, who had opened one\neye--shut it hastily. The snores continued.\n\n\n\nMr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather uneasy, (because the bed\nwas between the window and the door of the bedroom). He opened the\nwindow a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line\non to the window sill. The rest of the line, with a hook at the end,\nremained in his hand.\n\nTommy Brock snored conscientiously. Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for\na minute; then he left the room again.\n\nTommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. There\nwas a noise outside the window. Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.\n\nMr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the\nhouse. On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any\nidea who was inside it, he would have pulled them out quickly.\n\n\n\nHis foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and\nBenjamin, but fortunately he thought that it was some more of Tommy\nBrock's work.\n\nHe took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and\nthen tied the rope to a tree.\n\nTommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window. He was\npuzzled.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and\nstaggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.\n\nTommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.\n\nMr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with\nthe hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost\napoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.\n\nMr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead. His legs\nwere dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.\n\nHe reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of\nthe tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.\n\n(Mr. Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house\nbeing unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a\nblanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon\nhim attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!\n\nIt seemed as though nothing would waken him--not even the flapping rope\nacross the bed.\n\nMr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again\nwith the pail of water. He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling\nover the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath,\nworked by a string, through the window.\n\n\n\nBut naturally being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy\nwhiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of\nthe hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.\n\nThe snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock's hind\nlegs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.\n\nMr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After\nconsiderable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug.\nThe empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over\nthe head of Tommy Brock.\n\nSurely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and\nup on the chair.\n\nAs he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once, he fetched a\nmilk jug, and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail\ngot fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop\nsplashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never\nmoved,--except one eye.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete. The pail was full of\nwater; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across\nthe window sill to the tree outside.\n\n\"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in\nthat bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort,\" said Mr. Tod.\n\n\n\nMr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went\nout of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his\nfootsteps over the tunnel.\n\nHe ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to\nlet fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock--\n\n\"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise,\" said Mr. Tod.\n\nThe moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr.\nTod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail\nof water instead of himself, and left the room also--grinning immensely.\n\nHe went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for\nthe moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had\ndragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to\ngnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty\nminutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it\nnearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.\n\n\n\nInside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a\npail rolling over and over.\n\nBut no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened\nattentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping\nfrom the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.\n\nIn the middle of the bed under the blanket, was a wet flattened\n_something_--much dinged in, in the middle where the pail had caught it\n(as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket\nand it was _not snoring any longer_.\n\nThere was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop\ndrip of water trickling from the mattress.\n\n\n\nMr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.\n\nThen he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the\nwindow; but the bundle never moved.\n\nYes--there was no doubt about it--it had turned out even better than he\nhad planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him\ndead!\n\n\"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will\nbring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun,\" said Mr. Tod.\n\n\"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to\nbleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be\nthoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a\nhot-water bottle.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda\nand scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the\nsmell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur.\"\n\nHe hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen--\"First I\nwill arrange the hole--then I will drag out that person in the\nblanket....\"\n\nHe opened the door....\n\nTommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from\nMr. Tod's tea-pot into Mr. Tod's tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and\ngrinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr.\nTod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all\nover the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor\nwould give way at each crash of falling furniture.\n\nThey crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and\nbushes, listening anxiously.\n\n\n\nInside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven\nwoke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.\n\nEverything was upset except the kitchen table.\n\nAnd everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen\nfender. The crockery was smashed to atoms.\n\nThe chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash,\nand there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.\n\nThe vases fell off the mantelpiece, the canisters fell off the shelf;\nthe kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of\nraspberry jam.\n\nAnd the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to\nbe uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the\ndoor.\n\nThen the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the\nbank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any\nlove lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out\nof the bushes--\n\n\"Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them! while I watch\nat the door.\"\n\nBut Benjamin was frightened--\n\n\"Oh; oh! they are coming back!\"\n\n\"No they are not.\"\n\n\"Yes they are!\"\n\n\"What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone\nquarry.\"\n\nStill Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--\n\n\"Be quick, it's all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that\nhe won't miss them.\"\n\nDecidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!\n\n\n\nAt home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.\n\nAfter quarrelling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a\nsleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer\ncould no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole;\nbut he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The\nday passed heavily.\n\nOld Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with\na chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had\nbeen having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her\nfeelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was\nwondering anxiously what she would do next.\n\n\n\nIn Mr. Tod's kitchen, amongst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his\nway to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the\noven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He\nlifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.\n\n\"I've got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?\"\n\nPeter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the\nwood.\n\nFive minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down\nBull Banks, half carrying half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty\nbump over the grass. They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit\nhole.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and\nBenjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit-babies\nwere rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They\nsoon recovered.\n\nA long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to\nMr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.\n\n\n\nOld Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner. Then Peter and\nBenjamin told their story--but they had not waited long enough to be\nable to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Tale of Mr. Tod, by Beatrix Potter"}

Her supportive, though misunderstanding husband, John, believes it is in her best interests to go on a rest cure after the birth of their child. The family spends the summer at a colonial mansion that has, in the narrator's words, \"something queer about it\". She and her husband move into an upstairs room that she assumes was once a nursery, having it serve as their bedroom due to its multitude of windows, which provide the air so needed in her recovery. In addition to the couple, John's sister Jennie is present; she serves as their housekeeper. Like most nurseries at the time the windows are barred, the wallpaper has been torn, and the floor is scratched. The narrator attributes all these to children, as most of the damage is isolated to their reach. Ultimately, though, the reader is left unsure as to the source of the room's damage.\nThe narrator devotes many journal entries to describing the wallpaper in the room â its \"yellow\" smell, its \"breakneck\" pattern, the missing patches, and the way it leaves yellow smears on the skin and clothing of anyone who touches it. She describes how the longer one stays in the bedroom, the more the wallpaper appears to mutate, especially in the moonlight. With no stimulus other than the wallpaper, the pattern and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator. She soon begins to see a figure in the design, and eventually comes to believe that a woman is creeping on all fours behind the pattern. Believing she must try to free the woman in the wallpaper, the woman begins to strip the remaining paper off the wall.\nOn the last day of summer, she locks herself in her room to strip the remains of the wallpaper. When John arrives home, she refuses to unlock the door. When he returns with the key, he finds her creeping around the room, circling the walls and touching the wallpaper. She exclaims, \"I've got out at last,...in spite of you and Jane\", and her husband faints as she continues to circle the room, stepping over his inert body each time she passes.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE YELLOW WALLPAPER ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE YELLOW WALLPAPER\n\nBy Charlotte Perkins Gilman\n\n\n\n\nIt is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure\nancestral halls for the summer.\n\nA colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house,\nand reach the height of romantic felicity--but that would be asking too\nmuch of fate!\n\nStill I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.\n\nElse, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long\nuntenanted?\n\nJohn laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.\n\nJohn is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an\nintense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of\nthings not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\n\nJohn is a physician, and PERHAPS--(I would not say it to a living\nsoul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my\nmind)--PERHAPS that is one reason I do not get well faster.\n\nYou see he does not believe I am sick!\n\nAnd what can one do?\n\nIf a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends\nand relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but\ntemporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency--what is one\nto do?\n\nMy brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says\nthe same thing.\n\nSo I take phosphates or phosphites--whichever it is, and tonics, and\njourneys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to \"work\"\nuntil I am well again.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with their ideas.\n\nPersonally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,\nwould do me good.\n\nBut what is one to do?\n\nI did write for a while in spite of them; but it DOES exhaust me a good\ndeal--having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\n\nI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more\nsociety and stimulus--but John says the very worst thing I can do is to\nthink about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.\n\nSo I will let it alone and talk about the house.\n\nThe most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the\nroad, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English\nplaces that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates\nthat lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and\npeople.\n\nThere is a DELICIOUS garden! I never saw such a garden--large and shady,\nfull of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors\nwith seats under them.\n\nThere were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\n\nThere was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and\ncoheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\n\nThat spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid, but I don't care--there is\nsomething strange about the house--I can feel it.\n\nI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt\nwas a DRAUGHT, and shut the window.\n\nI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to\nbe so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\n\nBut John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\ntake pains to control myself--before him, at least, and that makes me\nvery tired.\n\nI don't like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\npiazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\nchintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\n\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near\nroom for him if he took another.\n\nHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\ndirection.\n\nI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all\ncare from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\n\nHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect\nrest and all the air I could get. \"Your exercise depends on your\nstrength, my dear,\" said he, \"and your food somewhat on your appetite;\nbut air you can absorb all the time.\" So we took the nursery at the top\nof the house.\n\nIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look\nall ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then\nplayroom and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for\nlittle children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\n\nThe paint and paper look as if a boys' school had used it. It is\nstripped off--the paper--in great patches all around the head of my bed,\nabout as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of\nthe room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\n\nOne of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic\nsin.\n\nIt is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough\nto constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the\nlame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit\nsuicide--plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard\nof contradictions.\n\nThe color is repellent, almost revolting; a smouldering unclean yellow,\nstrangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\n\nIt is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in\nothers.\n\nNo wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to\nlive in this room long.\n\nThere comes John, and I must put this away,--he hates to have me write a\nword.\n\n\nWe have been here two weeks, and I haven't felt like writing before,\nsince that first day.\n\nI am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and\nthere is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of\nstrength.\n\nJohn is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\n\nI am glad my case is not serious!\n\nBut these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\n\nJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no REASON\nto suffer, and that satisfies him.\n\nOf course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my\nduty in any way!\n\nI meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and\nhere I am a comparative burden already!\n\nNobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am\nable,--to dress and entertain, and order things.\n\nIt is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!\n\nAnd yet I CANNOT be with him, it makes me so nervous.\n\nI suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about\nthis wall-paper!\n\nAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I\nwas letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a\nnervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\n\nHe said that after the wall-paper was changed it would be the heavy\nbedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of\nthe stairs, and so on.\n\n\"You know the place is doing you good,\" he said, \"and really, dear, I\ndon't care to renovate the house just for a three months' rental.\"\n\n\"Then do let us go downstairs,\" I said, \"there are such pretty rooms\nthere.\"\n\nThen he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose,\nand said he would go down to the cellar, if I wished, and have it\nwhitewashed into the bargain.\n\nBut he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\n\nIt is an airy and comfortable room as any one need wish, and, of course,\nI would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.\n\nI'm really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid\npaper.\n\nOut of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deepshaded\narbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\n\nOut of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf\nbelonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs\ndown there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these\nnumerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to\nfancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of\nstory-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner\nof excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to\ncheck the tendency. So I try.\n\nI think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it\nwould relieve the press of ideas and rest me.\n\nBut I find I get pretty tired when I try.\n\nIt is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about\nmy work. When I get really well, John says we will ask Cousin Henry and\nJulia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fireworks\nin my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.\n\nI wish I could get well faster.\n\nBut I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it KNEW\nwhat a vicious influence it had!\n\nThere is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and\ntwo bulbous eyes stare at you upside down.\n\nI get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the\neverlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,\nunblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths\ndidn't match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little\nhigher than the other.\n\nI never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all\nknow how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and\nget more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture\nthan most children could find in a toy store.\n\nI remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big, old bureau used to\nhave, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.\n\nI used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could\nalways hop into that chair and be safe.\n\nThe furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for\nwe had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used\nas a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I\nnever saw such ravages as the children have made here.\n\nThe wall-paper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh\ncloser than a brother--they must have had perseverance as well as\nhatred.\n\nThen the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster\nitself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed which is all\nwe found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\n\nBut I don't mind it a bit--only the paper.\n\nThere comes John's sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of\nme! I must not let her find me writing.\n\nShe is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better\nprofession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me\nsick!\n\nBut I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these\nwindows.\n\nThere is one that commands the road, a lovely shaded winding road, and\none that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of\ngreat elms and velvet meadows.\n\nThis wall-paper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a\nparticularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,\nand not clearly then.\n\nBut in the places where it isn't faded and where the sun is just so--I\ncan see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to\nskulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\n\nThere's sister on the stairs!\n\n\nWell, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired\nout. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we\njust had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.\n\nOf course I didn't do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.\n\nBut it tired me all the same.\n\nJohn says if I don't pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in\nthe fall.\n\nBut I don't want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands\nonce, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!\n\nBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\n\nI don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything,\nand I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\n\nI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\n\nOf course I don't when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am\nalone.\n\nAnd I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by\nserious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\n\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\nporch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\n\nI'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall-paper. Perhaps\nBECAUSE of the wall-paper.\n\nIt dwells in my mind so!\n\nI lie here on this great immovable bed--it is nailed down, I\nbelieve--and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as\ngymnastics, I assure you. I start, we'll say, at the bottom, down in the\ncorner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the\nthousandth time that I WILL follow that pointless pattern to some sort\nof a conclusion.\n\nI know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was\nnot arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or\nsymmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.\n\nIt is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.\n\nLooked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and\nflourishes--a kind of \"debased Romanesque\" with delirium tremens--go\nwaddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.\n\nBut, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling\noutlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of\nwallowing seaweeds in full chase.\n\nThe whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I\nexhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that\ndirection.\n\nThey have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds\nwonderfully to the confusion.\n\nThere is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when\nthe crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can\nalmost fancy radiation after all,--the interminable grotesques seem to\nform around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal\ndistraction.\n\nIt makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap I guess.\n\nI don't know why I should write this.\n\nI don't want to.\n\nI don't feel able.\n\nAnd I know John would think it absurd. But I MUST say what I feel and\nthink in some way--it is such a relief!\n\nBut the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.\n\nHalf the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.\n\nJohn says I musn't lose my strength, and has me take cod liver oil and\nlots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.\n\nDear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried\nto have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell\nhim how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and\nJulia.\n\nBut he said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there;\nand I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying\nbefore I had finished.\n\nIt is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this\nnervous weakness I suppose.\n\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs\nand laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my\nhead.\n\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I\nmust take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.\n\nHe says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will\nand self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.\n\nThere's one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to\noccupy this nursery with the horrid wall-paper.\n\nIf we had not used it, that blessed child would have! What a fortunate\nescape! Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, an impressionable little\nthing, live in such a room for worlds.\n\nI never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here\nafter all, I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.\n\nOf course I never mention it to them any more--I am too wise,--but I\nkeep watch of it all the same.\n\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\n\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\n\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\n\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\npattern. I don't like it a bit. I wonder--I begin to think--I wish John\nwould take me away from here!\n\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\nand because he loves me so.\n\nBut I tried it last night.\n\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around just as the sun does.\n\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\none window or another.\n\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched\nthe moonlight on that undulating wall-paper till I felt creepy.\n\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she\nwanted to get out.\n\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper DID move, and when\nI came back John was awake.\n\n\"What is it, little girl?\" he said. \"Don't go walking about like\nthat--you'll get cold.\"\n\nI though it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was not\ngaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\n\n\"Why darling!\" said he, \"our lease will be up in three weeks, and I\ncan't see how to leave before.\n\n\"The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just\nnow. Of course if you were in any danger, I could and would, but you\nreally are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor,\ndear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is\nbetter, I feel really much easier about you.\"\n\n\"I don't weigh a bit more,\" said I, \"nor as much; and my appetite may be\nbetter in the evening when you are here, but it is worse in the morning\nwhen you are away!\"\n\n\"Bless her little heart!\" said he with a big hug, \"she shall be as sick\nas she pleases! But now let's improve the shining hours by going to\nsleep, and talk about it in the morning!\"\n\n\"And you won't go away?\" I asked gloomily.\n\n\"Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will\ntake a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house\nready. Really dear you are better!\"\n\n\"Better in body perhaps--\" I began, and stopped short, for he sat up\nstraight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I\ncould not say another word.\n\n\"My darling,\" said he, \"I beg of you, for my sake and for our child's\nsake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant\nlet that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so\nfascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish\nfancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?\"\n\nSo of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before\nlong. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn't, and lay there for\nhours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern\nreally did move together or separately.\n\n\nOn a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a\ndefiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.\n\nThe color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating\nenough, but the pattern is torturing.\n\nYou think you have mastered it, but just as you get well underway in\nfollowing, it turns a back-somersault and there you are. It slaps you\nin the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad\ndream.\n\nThe outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.\nIf you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of\ntoadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions--why, that is\nsomething like it.\n\nThat is, sometimes!\n\nThere is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems\nto notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.\n\nWhen the sun shoots in through the east window--I always watch for that\nfirst long, straight ray--it changes so quickly that I never can quite\nbelieve it.\n\nThat is why I watch it always.\n\nBy moonlight--the moon shines in all night when there is a moon--I\nwouldn't know it was the same paper.\n\nAt night in any kind of light, in twilight, candle light, lamplight, and\nworst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean,\nand the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\n\nI didn't realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind,\nthat dim sub-pattern, but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\n\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps\nher so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.\n\nI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep\nall I can.\n\nIndeed he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each\nmeal.\n\nIt is a very bad habit I am convinced, for you see I don't sleep.\n\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don't tell them I'm awake--O no!\n\nThe fact is I am getting a little afraid of John.\n\nHe seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.\n\nIt strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis,--that\nperhaps it is the paper!\n\nI have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into\nthe room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I've caught him\nseveral times LOOKING AT THE PAPER! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with\nher hand on it once.\n\nShe didn't know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a\nvery quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she\nwas doing with the paper--she turned around as if she had been caught\nstealing, and looked quite angry--asked me why I should frighten her so!\n\nThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had\nfound yellow smooches on all my clothes and John's, and she wished we\nwould be more careful!\n\nDid not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern,\nand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\n\n\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\nsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\nbetter, and am more quiet than I was.\n\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day,\nand said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall-paper.\n\nI turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was\nBECAUSE of the wall-paper--he would make fun of me. He might even want\nto take me away.\n\nI don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week\nmore, and I think that will be enough.\n\n\nI'm feeling ever so much better! I don't sleep much at night, for it\nis so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the\ndaytime.\n\nIn the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\n\nThere are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow\nall over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried\nconscientiously.\n\nIt is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It makes me think of all\nthe yellow things I ever saw--not beautiful ones like buttercups, but\nold foul, bad yellow things.\n\nBut there is something else about that paper--the smell! I noticed it\nthe moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was\nnot bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows\nare open or not, the smell is here.\n\nIt creeps all over the house.\n\nI find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in\nthe hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\n\nIt gets into my hair.\n\nEven when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise\nit--there is that smell!\n\nSuch a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it,\nto find what it smelled like.\n\nIt is not bad--at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most\nenduring odor I ever met.\n\nIn this damp weather it is awful, I wake up in the night and find it\nhanging over me.\n\nIt used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\nhouse--to reach the smell.\n\nBut now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like\nis the COLOR of the paper! A yellow smell.\n\nThere is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard.\nA streak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of\nfurniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even SMOOCH, as if it had\nbeen rubbed over and over.\n\nI wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round\nand round and round--round and round and round--it makes me dizzy!\n\n\nI really have discovered something at last.\n\nThrough watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally\nfound out.\n\nThe front pattern DOES move--and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!\n\nSometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes\nonly one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all\nover.\n\nThen in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady\nspots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\n\nAnd she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb\nthrough that pattern--it strangles so; I think that is why it has so\nmany heads.\n\nThey get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them\nupside down, and makes their eyes white!\n\nIf those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\n\n\nI think that woman gets out in the daytime!\n\nAnd I'll tell you why--privately--I've seen her!\n\nI can see her out of every one of my windows!\n\nIt is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women\ndo not creep by daylight.\n\nI see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a\ncarriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\n\nI don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught\ncreeping by daylight!\n\nI always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can't do it at night,\nfor I know John would suspect something at once.\n\nAnd John is so queer now, that I don't want to irritate him. I wish he\nwould take another room! Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman\nout at night but myself.\n\nI often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\n\nBut, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\n\nAnd though I always see her, she MAY be able to creep faster than I can\nturn!\n\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\nfast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\n\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\nto try it, little by little.\n\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan't tell it this time! It\ndoes not do to trust people too much.\n\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\nis beginning to notice. I don't like the look in his eyes.\n\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She\nhad a very good report to give.\n\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\n\nJohn knows I don't sleep very well at night, for all I'm so quiet!\n\nHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving\nand kind.\n\nAs if I couldn't see through him!\n\nStill, I don't wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three\nmonths.\n\nIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly\naffected by it.\n\n\nHurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town\nover night, and won't be out until this evening.\n\nJennie wanted to sleep with me--the sly thing! but I told her I should\nundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\n\nThat was clever, for really I wasn't alone a bit! As soon as it was\nmoonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\ngot up and ran to help her.\n\nI pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we\nhad peeled off yards of that paper.\n\nA strip about as high as my head and half around the room.\n\nAnd then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me,\nI declared I would finish it to-day!\n\nWe go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to\nleave things as they were before.\n\nJennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I\ndid it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.\n\nShe laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself, but I must not\nget tired.\n\nHow she betrayed herself that time!\n\nBut I am here, and no person touches this paper but me--not ALIVE!\n\nShe tried to get me out of the room--it was too patent! But I said it\nwas so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down\nagain and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner--I would\ncall when I woke.\n\nSo now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,\nand there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the\ncanvas mattress we found on it.\n\nWe shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.\n\nI quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.\n\nHow those children did tear about here!\n\nThis bedstead is fairly gnawed!\n\nBut I must get to work.\n\nI have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\n\nI don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, till\nJohn comes.\n\nI want to astonish him.\n\nI've got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman\ndoes get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\n\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\n\nThis bed will NOT move!\n\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\nbit off a little piece at one corner--but it hurt my teeth.\n\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor.\nIt sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\nheads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\nderision!\n\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\ntry.\n\nBesides I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\n\nI don't like to LOOK out of the windows even--there are so many of those\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\n\nI wonder if they all come out of that wall-paper as I did?\n\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope--you don't get ME\nout in the road there!\n\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\nnight, and that is hard!\n\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\nplease!\n\nI don't want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennie asks me to.\n\nFor outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green\ninstead of yellow.\n\nBut here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in\nthat long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.\n\nWhy there's John at the door!\n\nIt is no use, young man, you can't open it!\n\nHow he does call and pound!\n\nNow he's crying for an axe.\n\nIt would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!\n\n\"John dear!\" said I in the gentlest voice, \"the key is down by the front\nsteps, under a plantain leaf!\"\n\nThat silenced him for a few moments.\n\nThen he said--very quietly indeed, \"Open the door, my darling!\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said I. \"The key is down by the front door under a plantain\nleaf!\"\n\nAnd then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and\nsaid it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it of course, and\ncame in. He stopped short by the door.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he cried. \"For God's sake, what are you doing!\"\n\nI kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\n\n\"I've got out at last,\" said I, \"in spite of you and Jane. And I've\npulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!\"\n\nNow why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my\npath by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman"}
{"doc_id": "ced6d9c14fd61bbdb72a24dc2f5f90dbbeb0a30c", "token_count": 11630, "summary": " \"Where Love Is, God Is\" is a short story about a shoemaker named Martin Avdeitch. The story begins with a background on Martin's life. He was a fine cobbler as he did his work well and never promised to do something that he could not do. He stayed busy with his work in his basement that had only one window. Through this window he could see only the feet of people. He was still able to recognize most people by their shoes as he had worked with most of the shoes at least once. He had a wife, but she died, and all their children had died in their infancy except a three-year-old son.\nAfter he thought about sending him off to live with his sister he decided to care for the child himself. Martin however, was not destined to have a child as his son died a few years later with a fever. In grief, he denied God, wondering how He could allow such a thing to happen to him. One day a missionary visited Martin and Martin told him of his hardships. This missionary told Martin that he should live his life for God and not deny Him because God's will is the ultimate deciding factor and as humans we cannot question that. The missionary's words sank deep into Martin. After this encounter Martin went out and bought a large print Testament.\nHe began to read the Bible, at first only on holidays, but as he read more and more it became daily. His life became full with peace and joy. After his day of work he would sit down with a lamp and read. One night Martin read a passage about a Pharisee had invited Jesus into his house, and in the house a woman anointed and washed Jesus' feet with her tears. Martin thought of himself as the Pharisee in that story as he was only living for himself. As Martin slept he thought he heard the voice of God telling him that He would visit him the next day.\nThe next morning Martin skeptically watched out his window for God. While he was searching for God he saw Stepanitch shoveling away snow. Martin invited him in for a warm drink and they talked for a while. Martin told Stepanitch about Jesus' and the Pharisee and Stepanitch was moved to tears. Stepanitch later left and thanked Martin for the food, both for the soul and body.\nMartin later saw a young woman outside with a baby not properly dressed for the cold. He invited her in for some food and gave her warmer clothes and money. Martin also told her about Jesus and she thanked him and left. Then he saw a young boy stealing from an older lady. He went outside and settled their argument as he extended love and compassion towards the both of them.\nThat night while Martin wondered why God had not visited him three figures appeared in his home, the three people he had showed hospitality to that day. They said that when he helped them he was helping God. Martin then realized that God had indeed visited him, and he accepted Him well.\nShoemaker Martin (1997), a children's book by Brigitte Hanhart, is based on this story.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK WHERE LOVE IS THERE GOD IS ALSO ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Gerard Arthus, Charlene Taylor, Jana Srna and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images\ngenerously made available by The Internet Archive/American\nLibraries.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [ Transcriber's Notes:\n\n    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as\n    possible, including any non-standard spelling.\n\n    Italic text has been marked with _underscores_.\n  ]\n\n\n\n\n  WHERE LOVE IS\n  THERE GOD IS ALSO\n\n  BY\n  LYOF N.

Crowell & Co.\n\n\n\n\nWHERE LOVE IS THERE GOD IS ALSO\n\n\nIn the city lived the shoemaker, Martuin Avdyeitch. He lived in a\nbasement, in a little room with one window. The window looked out on the\nstreet. Through the window he used to watch the people passing by;\nalthough only their feet could be seen, yet by the boots, Martuin\nAvdyeitch recognized the people. Martuin Avdyeitch had lived long in one\nplace, and had many acquaintances. Few pairs of boots in his district\nhad not been in his hands once and again. Some he would half-sole, some\nhe would patch, some he would stitch around, and occasionally he would\nalso put on new uppers. And through the window he often recognized his\nwork.\n\nAvdyeitch had plenty to do, because he was a faithful workman, used good\nmaterial, did not make exorbitant charges, and kept his word. If it was\npossible for him to finish an order by a certain time, he would accept\nit; otherwise, he would not deceive you,--he would tell you so\nbeforehand. And all knew Avdyeitch, and he was never out of work.\n\nAvdyeitch had always been a good man; but as he grew old, he began to\nthink more about his soul, and get nearer to God. Martuin's wife had\ndied when he was still living with his master. His wife left him a boy\nthree years old. None of their other children had lived. All the eldest\nhad died in childhood. Martuin at first intended to send his little son\nto his sister in the village, but afterward he felt sorry for him; he\nthought to himself:--\n\n\"It will be hard for my Kapitoshka to live in a strange family. I shall\nkeep him with me.\"\n\nAnd Avdyeitch left his master, and went into lodgings with his little\nson. But God gave Avdyeitch no luck with his children. As Kapitoshka\ngrew older, he began to help his father, and would have been a delight\nto him, but a sickness fell on him, he went to bed, suffered a week, and\ndied. Martuin buried his son, and fell into despair. So deep was this\ndespair that he began to complain of God. Martuin fell into such a\nmelancholy state, that more than once he prayed to God for death, and\nreproached God because He had not taken him who was an old man, instead\nof his beloved only son. Avdyeitch also ceased to go to church.\n\nAnd once a little old man from the same district came from TroÃ¯tsa(1) to\nsee Avdyeitch; for seven years he had been wandering about. Avdyeitch\ntalked with him, and began to complain about his sorrows.\n\n  (1) Trinity, a famous monastery, pilgrimage to which is reckoned a\n  virtue. Avdyeitch calls this _zemlyak-starichok_, _Bozhi chelovyek_,\n  God's man.--Ed.\n\n\"I have no desire to live any longer,\" he said, \"I only wish I was dead.\nThat is all I pray God for. I am a man without anything to hope for\nnow.\"\n\nAnd the little old man said to him:--\n\n\"You don't talk right, Martuin, we must not judge God's doings. The\nworld moves, not by our skill, but by God's will. God decreed for your\nson to die,--for you--to live. So it is for the best. And you are in\ndespair, because you wish to live for your own happiness.\"\n\n\"But what shall one live for?\" asked Martuin.\n\nAnd the little old man said:--\n\n\"We must live for God, Martuin. He gives you life, and for His sake you\nmust live. When you begin to live for Him, you will not grieve over\nanything, and all will seem easy to you.\"\n\nMartuin kept silent for a moment, and then said, \"But how can one live\nfor God?\"\n\nAnd the little old man said:--\n\n\"Christ has taught us how to live for God. You know how to read? Buy a\nTestament, and read it; there you will learn how to live for God.\nEverything is explained there.\"\n\nAnd these words kindled a fire in Avdyeitch's heart. And he went that\nvery same day, bought a New Testament in large print, and began to read.\n\nAt first Avdyeitch intended to read only on holidays; but as he began to\nread, it so cheered his soul that he used to read every day. At times he\nwould become so absorbed in reading, that all the kerosene in the lamp\nwould burn out, and still he could not tear himself away. And so\nAvdyeitch used to read every evening.\n\nAnd the more he read, the clearer he understood what God wanted of him,\nand how one should live for God; and his heart kept growing easier and\neasier. Formerly, when he lay down to sleep, he used to sigh and groan,\nand always thought of his Kapitoshka; and now his only exclamation\nwas:--\n\n\"Glory to Thee! glory to Thee, Lord! Thy will be done.\"\n\nAnd from that time Avdyeitch's whole life was changed. In other days he,\ntoo, used to drop into a public-house(2) as a holiday amusement, to\ndrink a cup of tea; and he was not averse to a little brandy, either. He\nwould take a drink with some acquaintance, and leave the saloon, not\nintoxicated, exactly, yet in a happy frame of mind, and inclined to talk\nnonsense, and shout, and use abusive language at a person. Now he left\noff that sort of thing. His life became quiet and joyful. In the morning\nhe would sit down to work, finish his allotted task, then take the\nlittle lamp from the hook, put it on the table, get his book from the\nshelf, open it, and sit down to read. And the more he read, the more he\nunderstood, and the brighter and happier it grew in his heart.\n\n  (2) _Traktir._\n\nOnce it happened that Martuin read till late into the night. He was\nreading the Gospel of Luke. He was reading over the sixth chapter; and\nhe was reading the verses:--\n\n\"_And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other;\nand him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.\nGive to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy\ngoods ask them not again. And as ye would that men should do to you, do\nye also to them likewise._\"\n\nHe read farther also those verses, where God speaks:\n\n\"_And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\nWhosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will\nshew you to whom he is like: he is like a man which built an house, and\ndigged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood\narose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake\nit; for it was founded upon a rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not,\nis like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth;\nagainst which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell;\nand the ruin of that house was great._\"\n\nAvdyeitch read these words, and joy filled his soul. He took off his\nspectacles, put them down on the book, leaned his elbows on the table,\nand became lost in thought. And he began to measure his life by these\nwords. And he thought to himself:--\n\n\"Is my house built on the rock, or on the sand? 'Tis well if on the\nrock. It is so easy when you are alone by yourself; it seems as if you\nhad done everything as God commands; but when you forget yourself, you\nsin again. Yet I shall still struggle on. It is very good. Help me,\nLord!\"\n\nThus ran his thoughts; he wanted to go to bed, but he felt loath to tear\nhimself away from the book. And he began to read farther in the seventh\nchapter. He read about the centurion, he read about the widow's son, he\nread about the answer given to John's disciples, and finally he came to\nthat place where the rich Pharisee desired the Lord to sit at meat with\nhim; and he read how the woman that was a sinner anointed His feet, and\nwashed them with her tears, and how He forgave her. He reached the\nforty-fourth verse, and began to read:--\n\n\"_And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this\nwoman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet:\nbut she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of\nher head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came\nin hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not\nanoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment._\"\n\nHe finished reading these verses, and thought to himself:--\n\n\"_Thou gavest me no water for my feet, thou gavest me no kiss. My head\nwith oil thou didst not anoint._\"\n\nAnd again Avdyeitch took off his spectacles, put them down on the book,\nand again he became lost in thought.\n\n\"It seems that Pharisee must have been such a man as I am. I, too,\napparently have thought only of myself,--how I might have my tea, be\nwarm and comfortable, but never to think about my guest. He thought\nabout himself, but there was not the least care taken of the guest. And\nwho was his guest? The Lord Himself. If He had come to me, should I have\ndone the same way?\"\n\nAvdyeitch rested his head upon both his arms, and did not notice that he\nfell asleep.\n\n\"Martuin!\" suddenly seemed to sound in his ears.\n\nMartuin started from his sleep:--\n\n\"Who is here?\"\n\nHe turned around, glanced toward the door--no one.\n\nAgain he fell into a doze. Suddenly, he plainly heard:--\n\n\"Martuin! Ah, Martuin! look to-morrow on the street. I am coming.\"\n\nMartuin awoke, rose from the chair, began to rub his eyes. He himself\ncould not tell whether he heard those words in his dream, or in reality.\nHe turned down his lamp, and went to bed.\n\nAt daybreak next morning, Avdyeitch rose, made his prayer to God,\nlighted the stove, put on the shchi(3) and the kasha,(4) put the water\nin the samovar, put on his apron, and sat down by the window to work.\n\n  (3) Cabbage-soup.\n\n  (4) Gruel.\n\nAnd while he was working, he kept thinking about all that had happened\nthe day before. It seemed to him at one moment that it was a dream, and\nnow he had really heard a voice.\n\n\"Well,\" he said to himself, \"such things have been.\"\n\nMartuin was sitting by the window, and looking out more than he was\nworking. When anyone passed by in boots which he did not know, he would\nbend down, look out of the window, in order to see, not only the feet,\nbut also the face.\n\nThe dvornik(5) passed by in new felt boots,(6) the water-carrier passed\nby; then there came up to the window an old soldier of Nicholas's time,\nin an old pair of laced felt boots, with a shovel in his hands.\nAvdyeitch recognized him by his felt boots. The old man's name was\nStepanuitch; and a neighboring merchant, out of charity, gave him a home\nwith him. He was required to assist the dvornik. Stepanuitch began to\nshovel away the snow from in front of Avdyeitch's window. Avdyeitch\nglanced at him, and took up his work again.\n\n  (5) House-porter.\n\n  (6) _Valenki._\n\n\"Pshaw! I must be getting crazy in my old age,\" said Avdyeitch, and\nlaughed at himself. \"Stepanuitch is clearing away the snow, and I\nimagine that Christ is coming to see me. I was entirely out of my mind,\nold dotard that I am!\"\n\nAvdyeitch sewed about a dozen stitches, and then felt impelled to look\nthrough the window again. He looked out again through the window, and\nsaw that Stepanuitch had leaned his shovel against the wall, and was\nwarming himself, and resting. He was an old, broken-down man; evidently\nhe had not strength enough even to shovel the snow. Avdyeitch said to\nhimself:--\n\n\"I will give him some tea; by the way, the samovar has only just gone\nout.\" Avdyeitch laid down his awl, rose from his seat, put the samovar\non the table, poured out the tea, and tapped with his finger at the\nglass. Stepanuitch turned around, and came to the window. Avdyeitch\nbeckoned to him, and went to open the door.\n\n\"Come in, warm yourself a little,\" he said. \"You must be cold.\"\n\n\"May Christ reward you for this! my bones ache,\" said Stepanuitch.\n\nStepanuitch came in, and shook off the snow, tried to wipe his feet, so\nas not to soil the floor, but staggered.\n\n\"Don't trouble to wipe your feet. I will clean it up myself; we are used\nto such things. Come in and sit down,\" said Avdyeitch. \"Here, drink a\ncup of tea.\"\n\nAnd Avdyeitch lifted two glasses, and handed one to his guest; while he\nhimself poured his tea into a saucer, and began to blow it.\n\nStepanuitch finished drinking his glass of tea, turned the glass upside\ndown,(7) put the half-eaten lump of sugar on it, and began to express\nhis thanks. But it was evident he wanted some more.\n\n  (7) To signify he was satisfied; a custom among the Russians.--Ed.\n\n\"Have some more,\" said Avdyeitch, filling both his own glass and his\nguest's. Avdyeitch drank his tea, but from time to time glanced out into\nthe street.\n\n\"Are you expecting anyone?\" asked his guest.\n\n\"Am I expecting anyone? I am ashamed even to tell whom I expect. I am,\nand I am not, expecting someone; but one word has kindled a fire in my\nheart. Whether it is a dream, or something else, I do not know. Don't\nyou see, brother, I was reading yesterday the Gospel about Christ the\nBatyushka; how He suffered, how He walked on the earth. I suppose you\nhave heard about it?\"\n\n\"Indeed I have,\" replied Stepanuitch; \"but we are people in darkness, we\ncan't read.\"\n\n\"Well, now, I was reading about that very thing,--how He walked on the\nearth; I read, you know, how He came to the Pharisee, and the Pharisee\ndid not treat Him hospitably. Well, and so, my brother, I was reading\nyesterday, about this very thing, and was thinking to myself how he did\nnot receive Christ, the Batyushka, with honor. Suppose, for example, He\nshould come to me, or anyone else, I said to myself, I should not even\nknow how to receive Him. And he gave Him no reception at all. Well!\nwhile I was thus thinking, I fell asleep, brother, and I heard someone\ncall me by name. I got up; the voice, just as if someone whispered,\nsaid, 'Be on the watch; I shall come to-morrow.' And this happened\ntwice. Well! would you believe it, it got into my head? I scolded\nmyself--and yet I am expecting Him, the Batyushka.\"\n\nStepanuitch shook his head, and said nothing; he finished drinking his\nglass of tea, and put it on the side; but Avdyeitch picked up the glass\nagain, and filled it once more.\n\n\"Drink some more for your good health. You see, I have an idea that,\nwhen the Batyushka went about on this earth, He disdained no one, and\nhad more to do with the simple people. He always went to see the simple\npeople. He picked out His disciples more from among folk like such\nsinners as we are, from the working class. Said He, whoever exalts\nhimself, shall be humbled, and he who is humbled shall become exalted.\nSaid He, you call me Lord, and, said He, I wash your feet. Whoever\nwishes, said He, to be the first, the same shall be a servant to all.\nBecause, said He, blessed are the poor, the humble, the kind, the\ngenerous.\"\n\nAnd Stepanuitch forgot about his tea; he was an old man, and easily\nmoved to tears. He was listening, and the tears rolled down his face.\n\n\"Come, now, have some more tea,\" said Avdyeitch; but Stepanuitch made\nthe sign of the cross, thanked him, turned down his glass, and arose.\n\n\"Thanks to you,\" he says, \"Martuin Avdyeitch, for treating me kindly,\nand satisfying me, soul and body.\"\n\n\"You are welcome; come in again; always glad to see a friend,\" said\nAvdyeitch.\n\nStepanuitch departed; and Martuin poured out the rest of the tea, drank\nit up, put away the dishes, and sat down again by the window to work, to\nstitch on a patch. He kept stitching away, and at the same time looking\nthrough the window. He was expecting Christ, and was all the while\nthinking of Him and His deeds, and his head was filled with the\ndifferent speeches of Christ.\n\nTwo soldiers passed by: one wore boots furnished by the crown, and the\nother one, boots that he had made; then the master(8) of the next house\npassed by in shining galoshes; then a baker with a basket passed by. All\npassed by; and now there came also by the window a woman in woolen\nstockings and rustic bashmaks on her feet. She passed by the window, and\nstood still near the window-case.\n\n  (8) _KhozyaÃ¯n._\n\nAvdyeitch looked up at her from the window, and saw it was a stranger, a\nwoman poorly clad, and with a child; she was standing by the wall with\nher back to the wind, trying to wrap up the child, and she had nothing\nto wrap it up in. The woman was dressed in shabby summer clothes; and\nfrom behind the frame, Avdyeitch could hear the child crying, and the\nwoman trying to pacify it; but she was not able to pacify it.\n\nAvdyeitch got up, went to the door, ascended the steps, and cried:--\n\n\"My good woman. Hey! my good woman!\"(9)\n\n  (9) _Umnitsa aumnitsa!_ literally, clever one.\n\nThe woman heard him and turned around.\n\n\"Why are you standing in the cold with the child? Come into my room,\nwhere it is warm; you can manage it better. Here, this way!\"\n\nThe woman was astonished. She saw an old, old man in an apron, with\nspectacles on his nose, calling her to him. She followed him. They\ndescended the steps and entered the room; the old man led the woman to\nhis bed.\n\n\"There,\" says he, \"sit down, my good woman, nearer to the stove; you can\nget warm, and nurse the little one.\"\n\n\"I have no milk for him. I myself have not eaten anything since\nmorning,\" said the woman; but, nevertheless, she took the baby to her\nbreast.\n\nAvdyeitch shook his head, went to the table, brought out the bread and a\ndish, opened the oven door, poured into the dish some cabbage soup, took\nout the pot with the gruel, but it was not cooked as yet; so he filled\nthe dish with shchi only, and put it on the table. He got the bread,\ntook the towel down from the hook, and spread it upon the table.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he says, \"and eat, my good woman; and I will mind the little\none. You see, I once had children of my own; I know how to handle them.\"\n\nThe woman crossed herself, sat down at the table, and began to eat;\nwhile Avdyeitch took a seat on the bed near the infant. Avdyeitch kept\nsmacking and smacking to it with his lips; but it was a poor kind of\nsmacking, for he had no teeth. The little one kept on crying. And it\noccured to Avdyeitch to threaten the little one with his finger; he\nwaved, waved his finger right before the child's mouth, and hastily\nwithdrew it. He did not put it to its mouth, because his finger was\nblack, and soiled with wax. And the little one looked at his finger, and\nbecame quiet; then it began to smile, and Avdyeitch also was glad. While\nthe woman was eating, she told who she was, and whither she was going.\n\nSaid she:--\n\n\"I am a soldier's wife. It is now seven months since they sent my\nhusband away off, and no tidings. I lived out as cook; the baby was\nborn; no one cared to keep me with a child. This is the third month that\nI have been struggling along without a place. I ate up all I had. I\nwanted to engage as a wet-nurse--no one would take me--I am too thin,\nthey say. I have just been to the merchant's wife, where lives a young\nwoman I know, and so they promised to take us in. I thought that was the\nend of it. But she told me to come next week. And she lives a long way\noff. I got tired out; and it tired him, too, my heart's darling.\nFortunately, our landlady takes pity on us for the sake of Christ, and\ngives us a room, else I don't know how I should manage to get along.\"\n\nAvdyeitch sighed, and said:\n\n\"Haven't you any warm clothes?\"\n\n\"Now is the time, friend, to wear warm clothes; but yesterday I pawned\nmy last shawl for a twenty-kopek piece.\"(10)\n\n  (10) _Dvagrivennui_, silver, worth sixteen cents.\n\nThe woman came to the bed, and took the child; and Avdyeitch rose, went\nto the partition, rummaged round, and succeeded in finding an old coat.\n\n\"Na!\" says he; \"It is a poor thing, yet you may turn it to some use.\"\n\nThe woman looked at the coat and looked at the old man; she took the\ncoat, and burst into tears; and Avdyeitch turned away his head; crawling\nunder the bed, he pushed out a little trunk, rummaged in it, and sat\ndown again opposite the woman.\n\nAnd the woman said:--\n\n\"May Christ bless you, little grandfather!(11) He must have sent me to\nyour window. My little baby would have frozen to death. When I started\nout it was warm, but now it has grown cold. And He, the Batyushka, led\nyou to look through the window and take pity on me, an unfortunate.\"\n\n  (11) _Diedushka._\n\nAvdyeitch smiled, and said:--\n\n\"Indeed, He did that! I have been looking through the window, my good\nwoman, for some wise reason.\"\n\nAnd Martuin told the soldier's wife his dream, and how he heard the\nvoice,--how the Lord promised to come and see him that day.\n\n\"All things are possible,\" said the woman. She rose, put on the coat,\nwrapped up her little child in it; and, as she started to take leave,\nshe thanked Avdyeitch again.\n\n\"Take this, for Christ's sake,\" said Avdyeitch, giving her a\ntwenty-kopek piece; \"redeem your shawl.\"\n\nShe made the sign of the cross, and Avdyeitch made the sign of the cross\nand went with her to the door.\n\nThe woman went away. Avdyeitch ate some shchi, washed the dishes, and\nsat down again to work. While he was working he still remembered the\nwindow; when the window grew darker he immediately looked out to see who\nwas passing by. Acquaintances passed by and strangers passed by, and\nthere was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nBut here Avdyeitch saw that an old apple woman had stopped in front of\nhis window. She carried a basket with apples. Only a few were left, as\nshe had evidently sold them nearly all out; and over her shoulder she\nhad a bag full of chips. She must have gathered them up in some new\nbuilding, and was on her way home. One could see that the bag was heavy\non her shoulder; she tried to shift it to the other shoulder. So she\nlowered the bag on the sidewalk, stood the basket with the apples on a\nlittle post, and began to shake down the splinters in the bag. And while\nshe was shaking her bag, a little boy in a torn cap came along, picked\nup an apple from the basket, and was about to make his escape; but the\nold woman noticed it, turned around, and caught the youngster by his\nsleeve. The little boy began to struggle, tried to tear himself away;\nbut the old woman grasped him with both hands, knocked off his cap, and\ncaught him by the hair.\n\nThe little boy was screaming, the old woman was scolding. Avdyeitch lost\nno time in putting away his awl; he threw it upon the floor, sprang to\nthe door,--he even stumbled on the stairs, and dropped his\nspectacles,--and rushed out into the street.\n\nThe old woman was pulling the youngster by his hair, and was scolding\nand threatening to take him to the policeman; the youngster was\ndefending himself, and denying the charge.\n\n\"I did not take it,\" he said; \"What are you licking me for? Let me go!\"\n\nAvdyeitch tried to separate them. He took the boy by his arm, and\nsaid:--\n\n\"Let him go, babushka; forgive him, for Christ's sake.\"\n\n\"I will forgive him so that he won't forget it till the new broom grows.\nI am going to take the little villain to the police.\"\n\nAvdyeitch began to entreat the old woman:--\n\n\"Let him go, babushka,\" he said, \"he will never do it again. Let him go,\nfor Christ's sake.\"\n\nThe old woman let him loose; the boy started to run, but Avdyeitch kept\nhim back.\n\n\"Ask the babushka's forgiveness,\" he said, \"and don't you ever do it\nagain; I saw you take the apple.\"\n\nThe boy burst into tears, and began to ask forgiveness.\n\n\"There now! that's right; and here's an apple for you.\"\n\nAnd Avdyeitch took an apple from the basket, and gave it to the boy.\n\n\"I will pay you for it, babushka,\" he said to the old woman.\n\n\"You ruin them that way, the good-for-nothings,\" said the old woman. \"He\nought to be treated so that he would remember it for a whole week.\"\n\n\"Eh, babushka, babushka,\" said Avdyeitch, \"that is right according to\nour judgment, but not according to God's. If he is to be whipped for an\napple, then what ought to be done to us for our sins?\"\n\nThe old woman was silent.\n\nAnd Avdyeitch told her the parable of the master who forgave a debtor\nall that he owed him, and how the debtor went and began to choke one who\nowed him.\n\nThe old woman listened, and the boy stood listening.\n\n\"God has commanded us to forgive,\" said Avdyeitch, \"else we, too, may\nnot be forgiven. All should be forgiven, and the thoughtless\nespecially.\"\n\nThe old woman shook her head, and sighed.\n\n\"That's so,\" said she; \"but the trouble is that they are very much\nspoiled.\"\n\n\"Then we who are older must teach them,\" said Avdyeitch.\n\n\"That's just what I say,\" remarked the old woman. \"I myself have had\nseven of them,--only one daughter is left.\"\n\nAnd the old woman began to relate where and how she lived with her\ndaughter, and how many grandchildren she had. \"Here,\" she says, \"my\nstrength is only so-so, and yet I have to work. I pity the\nyoungsters--my grandchildren--but what nice children they are! No one\ngives me such a welcome as they do. Aksintka won't go to anyone but me.\n'Babushka, dear babushka, lovliest.'\"\n\nAnd the old woman grew quite sentimental.\n\n\"Of course, it is a childish trick. God be with him,\" said she, pointing\nto the boy.\n\nThe woman was just about to lift the bag up on her shoulder, when the\nboy ran up, and said:--\n\n\"Let me carry it, babushka; it is on my way.\"\n\nThe old woman nodded her head, and put the bag on the boy's back.\n\nAnd side by side they passed along the street.\n\nAnd the old woman even forgot to ask Avdyeitch to pay for the apple.\nAvdyeitch stood motionless, and kept gazing after them; and he heard\nthem talking all the time as they walked away. After Avdyeitch saw them\ndisappear, he returned to his room; he found his eye-glasses on the\nstairs,--they were not broken; he picked up his awl, and sat down to\nwork again.\n\nAfter working a little while, it grew darker, so that he could not see\nto sew; he saw the lamplighter passing by to light the street-lamps.\n\n\"It must be time to make a light,\" he said to himself; so he got his\nlittle lamp ready, hung it up, and he took himself again to his work. He\nhad one boot already finished; he turned it around, looked at it: \"Well\ndone.\" He put away his tools, swept off the cuttings, cleared off the\nbristles and ends, took the lamp, set it on the table, and took down the\nGospels from the shelf. He intended to open the book at the very place\nwhere he had yesterday put a piece of leather as a mark, but it happened\nto open at another place; and the moment Avdyeitch opened the Testament,\nhe recollected his last night's dream. And as soon as he remembered it,\nit seemed as if he heard someone stepping about behind him. Avdyeitch\nlooked around, and saw--there, in the dark corner, it seemed as if\npeople were standing; he was at a loss to know who they were. And a\nvoice whispered in his ear:--\n\n\"Martuin--ah, Martuin! did you not recognize me?\"\n\n\"Who?\" exclaimed Avdyeitch.\n\n\"Me,\" repeated the voice. \"It was I;\" and Stepanuitch stepped forth from\nthe dark corner; he smiled, and like a little cloud faded away, and soon\nvanished.\n\n\"And it was I,\" said the voice.\n\nFrom the dark corner stepped forth the woman with her child; the woman\nsmiled, the child laughed, and they also vanished,\n\n\"And it was I,\" continued the voice; both the old woman and the boy with\nthe apple stepped forward; both smiled and vanished.\n\nAvdyeitch's soul rejoiced; he crossed himself, put on his spectacles,\nand began to read the Evangelists where it happened to open. On the\nupper part of the page he read:--\n\n\"_For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave\nme drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in._\"\n\nAnd on the lower part of the page he read this:--\n\n\"_Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my\nbrethren, ye have done it unto me._\"--St. Matthew, Chap.Â xxv.\n\nAnd Avdyeitch understood that his dream had not deceived him; that the\nSaviour really called on him that day, and that he really received Him.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Where Love Is There God Is Also, by Lyof N.

Dr. Whipple has made extensive records tracking the mysterious, yet apparently, coincidental sickness and death of many who have lived in the house for over one hundred years. They are also puzzled by the strange weeds growing in the yard, as well as the unexplained foul smell, and whitish phosphorescent fungi growing in the cellar.\nAfter the protagonist discovers a strange, yellowish vapour in the basement, which seems to be coupled with a moldy outline of a huddled human form on the floor, he and his uncle decide to spend the night in the house, investigating the possibility of some supernatural force. They set up both cots and chairs in the cellar, arm themselves with military flamethrowers, and outfit a modified Crookes tube in the hopes of destroying any supernatural presence they might find.\nWhen Dr. Whipple naps, while his nephew keeps watch, he begins tossing and turning, and finally starts babbling in French, until he suddenly awakes. He tells the protagonist he had strange visions of lying in an open pit, inside a house with constantly shifting features, while faces stared down at him. Many of the faces were those of the Harris family, whose members died in the house.\nWhen the protagonist sleeps, he is awakened by a horrific scream. He sees a revolting yellowish \"corpse-light\" bubbling up from the floor, which stares at him with many eyes before vanishing in a wisp through the chimney. He finds his uncle transformed into a monster with \"blackened, decaying features\" and dripping claws. He turns on the Crookes tube, but seeing that it has no effect, escapes the house through the cellar door as his uncle's body dissolves, transforming into a multitude of faces of those who died in the house as it melts. The protagonist returns the next day to find his equipment intact, but no body.\nThe protagonist hatches a plan. He orders a military gas mask, digging tools, and six carboys of sulfuric acid to be delivered to the cellar door of the shunned house. He digs into the earthen floor of the cellar, turning up fungous yellow ooze, and arranges the barrels of acid around the hole in the belief that he will happen upon some kind of monstrous creature. Eventually, he uncovers a soft, blue-white, translucent tube, bent in half and two feet in diameter at its widest point. He frantically climbs out of the neck-deep hole, and dumps in four barrels of acid, realizing that he had found the elbow of a gigantic monster. The protagonist faints after emptying the fourth barrel.\nWhen he awakens, the protagonist empties the two remaining barrels, to no effect, replaces the dirt, and finds that the strange fungus has turned to harmless ash. He mourns his uncle, but is relieved to be sure that the horrible creature is finally dead. The protagonist records that the house has subsequently been rented to another family, and that the house now appears completely normal.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SHUNNED HOUSE ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        The\n                             Shunned House\n\n                        By H. P. LOVECRAFT\n\n\n _A posthumous story of immense power, written by a master of weird\n   fiction--a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old\n                       house in New England_\n\n\n    Howard Phillips Lovecraft died last March, at the height of his\n    career. Though only forty-six years of age, he had built up an\n    international reputation by the artistry and impeccable literary\n    craftsmanship of his weird tales; and he was regarded on both sides\n    of the Atlantic as probably the greatest contemporary master of\n    weird fiction. His ability to create and sustain a mood of brooding\n    dread and unnamable horror is nowhere better shown than in the\n    posthumous tale presented here: \"The Shunned House.\"\n\n\nFrom even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent. Sometimes it\nenters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it\nrelates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places. The\nlatter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city of\nProvidence, where in the late forties Edgar Allan Poe used to sojourn\noften during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess, Mrs.\nWhitman. Poe generally stopped at the Mansion House in Benefit\nStreet--the renamed Golden Ball Inn whose roof has sheltered Washington,\nJefferson, and Lafayette--and his favorite walk led northward along the\nsame street to Mrs. Whitman's home and the neighboring hillside\nchurchyard of St. John's, whose hidden expanse of Eighteenth Century\ngravestones had for him a peculiar fascination.\n\nNow the irony is this. In this walk, so many times repeated, the world's\ngreatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a\nparticular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquated\nstructure perched on the abruptly rising side hill, with a great unkempt\nyard dating from a time when the region was partly open country. It does\nnot appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it, nor is there any evidence\nthat he even noticed it. And yet that house, to the two persons in\npossession of certain information, equals or outranks in horror the\nwildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly, and\nstands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous.\n\nThe house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract the\nattention of the curious. Originally a farm or semi-farm building, it\nfollowed the average New England colonial lines of the middle Eighteenth\nCentury--the prosperous peaked-roof sort, with two stories and\ndormerless attic, and with the Georgian doorway and interior panelling\ndictated by the progress of taste at that time. It faced south, with one\ngable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and\nthe other exposed to the foundations toward the street. Its\nconstruction, over a century and a half ago, had followed the grading\nand straightening of the road in that especial vicinity; for Benefit\nStreet--at first called Back Street--was laid out as a lane winding\namongst the graveyards of the first settlers, and straightened only when\nthe removal of the bodies to the North Burial Ground made it decently\npossible to cut through the old family plots.\n\nAt the start, the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a\nprecipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at about\nthe time of the Revolution sheared off most of the intervening space,\nexposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made,\ngiving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and one window above\nground, close to the new line of public travel. When the sidewalk was\nlaid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was removed;\nand Poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull gray\nbrick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet by\nthe antique shingled bulk of the house proper.\n\n[Illustration: \"That awful door in Benefit Street which I had left\najar.\"]\n\nThe farm-like ground extended back very deeply up the hill, almost to\nWheaton Street. The space south of the house, abutting on Benefit\nStreet, was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level, forming\na terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by a\nsteep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon-like\nsurfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn, rheumy brick walks, and\nneglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns, rusted kettles fallen\nfrom tripods of knotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia set off the\nweather-beaten front door with its broken fanlight, rotting Ionic\npilasters, and wormy triangular pediment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat I heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people\ndied there in alarmingly great numbers. That, I was told, was why the\noriginal owners had moved out some twenty years after building the\nplace. It was plainly unhealthy, perhaps because of the dampness and\nfungous growths in the cellar, the general sickish smell, the drafts of\nthe hallways, or the quality of the well and pump water. These things\nwere bad enough, and these were all that gained belief among the persons\nwhom I knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle, Doctor Elihu\nWhipple, revealed to me at length the darker, vaguer surmises which\nformed an undercurrent of folklore among old-time servants and humble\nfolk; surmises which never travelled far, and which were largely\nforgotten when Providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting modern\npopulation.\n\nThe general fact is, that the house was never regarded by the solid part\nof the community as in any real sense \"haunted.\" There were no\nwidespread tales of rattling chains, cold currents of air, extinguished\nlights, or faces at the window. Extremists sometimes said the house was\n\"unlucky,\" but that is as far as even they went. What was really beyond\ndispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or more\naccurately, _had_ died there, since after some peculiar happenings over\nsixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheer\nimpossibility of renting it. These persons were not all cut off suddenly\nby any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously\nsapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to\nweakness he may have naturally had. And those who did not die displayed\nin varying degree a type of anemia or consumption, and sometimes a\ndecline of the mental faculties, which spoke ill for the salubriousness\nof the building. Neighboring houses, it must be added, seemed entirely\nfree from the noxious quality.\n\nThis much I knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show me\nthe notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation.\nIn my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled and\nterrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass and nightmarishly misshapen\nweeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered. We boys used\nto overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not only\nat the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the\neldritch atmosphere and odor of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked\nfront door was often entered in quest of shudders. The small-paned\nwindows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round\nthe precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall-paper,\nfalling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered\nfurniture as still remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of\nthe fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend\nthe ladder to the attic, a vast raftered length lighted only by small\nblinking windows in the gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage\nof chests, chairs, and spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposit\nhad shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes.\n\nBut after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house. It\nwas the dank, humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest repulsion\non us, even though it was wholly above ground on the street side, with\nonly a thin door and window-pierced brick wall to separate it from the\nbusy sidewalk. We scarcely knew whether to haunt it in spectral\nfascination, or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity. For\none thing, the bad odor of the house was strongest there; and for\nanother thing, we did not like the white fungous growths which\noccasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth\nfloor. Those fungi, grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside,\nwere truly horrible in their outlines; detestable parodies of toadstools\nand Indian-pipes, whose like we had never seen in any other situation.\nThey rotted quickly, and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent; so\nthat nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke of witch-fires glowing behind\nthe broken panes of the fetor-spreading windows.\n\nWe never--even in our wildest Halloween moods--visited this cellar\nby night, but in some of our daytime visits could detect the\nphosphorescence, especially when the day was dark and wet. There was\nalso a subtler thing we often thought we detected--a very strange thing\nwhich was, however, merely suggestive at most. I refer to a sort of\ncloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor--a vague, shifting deposit of\nmold or niter which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the\nsparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen.\nOnce in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblance\nto a doubled-up human figure, though generally no such kinship existed,\nand often there was no whitish deposit whatever.\n\nOn a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally\nstrong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I glimpsed a kind of thin,\nyellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward\nthe yawning fireplace, I spoke to my uncle about the matter. He smiled\nat this odd conceit, but it seemed that his smile was tinged with\nreminiscence. Later I heard that a similar notion entered into some of\nthe wild ancient tales of the common folk--a notion likewise alluding to\nghoulish, wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney, and\nqueer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree-roots that thrust\ntheir way into the cellar through the loose foundation-stones.\n\n\n2\n\nNot till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and data\nwhich he had collected concerning the shunned house. Doctor Whipple was\na sane, conservative physician of the old school, and for all his\ninterest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts toward\nthe abnormal. His own view, postulating simply a building and location\nof markedly unsanitary qualities, had nothing to do with abnormality;\nbut he realized that the very picturesqueness which aroused his own\ninterest would in a boy's fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome\nimaginative associations.\n\nThe doctor was a bachelor; a white-haired, clean-shaven, old-fashioned\ngentleman, and a local historian of note, who had often broken a lance\nwith such controversial guardians of tradition as Sidney S. Rider and\nThomas W. Bicknell. He lived with one man-servant in a Georgian\nhomestead with knocker and iron-railed steps, balanced eerily on the\nsteep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court and\ncolony house where his grandfather--a cousin of that celebrated\nprivateersman, Captain Whipple, who burnt His Majesty's armed schooner\n_Gaspee_ in 1772--had voted in the legislature on May 4, 1776, for the\nindependence of the Rhode Island Colony. Around him in the damp,\nlow-ceiled library with the musty white panelling, heavy carved\novermantel and small-paned, vine-shaded windows, were the relics and\nrecords of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusions\nto the shunned house in Benefit Street. That pest spot lies not far\ndistant--for Benefit runs ledgewise just above the court house along the\nprecipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed.\n\nWhen, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from\nmy uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enough\nchronicle. Long-winded, statistical, and drearily genealogical as some\nof the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding,\ntenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me even\nmore than it had impressed the good doctor. Separate events fitted\ntogether uncannily, and seemingly irrelevant details held mines of\nhideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, compared\nto which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate.\n\nThe first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that\nshuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine. For at\nthe last my uncle insisted on joining the search I had commenced, and\nafter a certain night in that house he did not come away with me. I am\nlonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only with\nhonor, virtue, good taste, benevolence, and learning. I have reared a\nmarble urn to his memory in St. John's churchyard--the place that Poe\nloved--the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill, where tombs and\nheadstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the\nhouses and bank walls of Benefit Street.\n\nThe history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed no\ntrace of the sinister either about its construction or about the\nprosperous and honorable family who built it. Yet from the first a taint\nof calamity, soon increased to boding significance, was apparent. My\nuncle's carefully compiled record began with the building of the\nstructure in 1763, and followed the theme with an unusual amount of\ndetail. The shunned house, it seems, was first inhabited by William\nHarris and his wife Rhoby Dexter, with their children, Elkanah, born in\n1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William, Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, born\nin 1761. Harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the West India\ntrade, connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. After\nBrown's death in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown & Company made him\nmaster of the brig _Prudence_, Providence-built, of 120 tons, thus\nenabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since his\nmarriage.\n\nThe site he had chosen--a recently straightened part of the new and\nfashionable Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill above\ncrowded Cheapside--was all that could be wished, and the building did\njustice to the location. It was the best that moderate means could\nafford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child\nwhich the family expected. That child, a boy, came in December; but was\nstill-born. Nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a\ncentury and a half.\n\nThe next April, sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail and\nRuth died before the month was over. Doctor Job Ives diagnosed the\ntrouble as some infantile fever, though others declared it was more of a\nmere wasting-away or decline. It seemed, in any event, to be contagious;\nfor Hannah Bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the following\nJune. Eli Lideason, the other servant, constantly complained of\nweakness; and would have returned to his father's farm in Rehoboth but\nfor a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was hired to succeed\nHannah. He died the next year--a sad year indeed, since it marked the\ndeath of William Harris himself, enfeebled as he was by the climate of\nMartinique, where his occupation had kept him for considerable periods\nduring the preceding decade.\n\nThe widowed Rhoby Harris never recovered from the shock of her husband's\ndeath, and the passing of her first-born Elkanah two years later was the\nfinal blow to her reason. In 1768 she fell victim to a mild form of\ninsanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house;\nher elder maiden sister, Mercy Dexter, having moved in to take charge of\nthe family. Mercy was a plain, raw-boned woman of great strength; but\nher health visibly declined from the time of her advent. She was greatly\ndevoted to her unfortunate sister, and had an especial affection for her\nonly surviving nephew William, who from a sturdy infant had become a\nsickly, spindling lad. In this year the servant Mehitabel died, and the\nother servant, Preserved Smith, left without coherent explanation--or at\nleast, with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked the\nsmell of the place. For a time Mercy could secure no more help, since\nthe seven deaths and case of madness, all occurring within five years'\nspace, had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumor which later\nbecame so bizarre. Ultimately, however, she obtained new servants from\nout of town; Ann White, a morose woman from that part of North Kingstown\nnow set off as the township of Exeter, and a capable Boston man named\nZenas Low.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was Ann White who first gave definite shape to the sinister idle\ntalk. Mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from the\nNooseneck Hill country, for that remote bit of backwoods was then, as\nnow, a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions. As lately as 1892\nan Exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt its\nheart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations injurious to the\npublic health and peace, and one may imagine the point of view of the\nsame section in 1768. Ann's tongue was perniciously active, and within a\nfew months Mercy discharged her, filling her place with a faithful and\namiable Amazon from Newport, Maria Robbins.\n\nMeanwhile poor Rhoby Harris, in her madness, gave voice to dreams and\nimaginings of the most hideous sort. At times her screams became\ninsupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors\nwhich necessitated her son's temporary residence with his cousin, Peleg\nHarris, in Presbyterian Lane near the new college building. The boy\nwould seem to improve after these visits, and had Mercy been as wise as\nshe was well-meaning, she would have let him live permanently with\nPeleg. Just what Mrs. Harris cried out in her fits of violence,\ntradition hesitates to say; or rather, presents such extravagant\naccounts that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity. Certainly\nit sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of\nFrench often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that\nlanguage, or that the same person, alone and guarded, complained wildly\nof a staring thing which bit and chewed at her. In 1772 the servant\nZenas died, and when Mrs. Harris heard of it she laughed with a shocking\ndelight utterly foreign to her. The next year she herself died, and was\nlaid to rest in the North Burial Ground beside her husband.\n\nUpon the outbreak of trouble with Great Britain in 1775, William Harris,\ndespite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution, managed to\nenlist in the Army of Observation under General Greene; and from that\ntime on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige. In 1780, as a\ncaptain in the Rhode Island forces in New Jersey under Colonel Angell,\nhe met and married Phebe Hetfield of Elizabethtown, whom he brought to\nProvidence upon his honorable discharge in the following year.\n\nThe young soldier's return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness. The\nhouse, it is true, was still in good condition; and the street had been\nwidened and changed in name from Back Street to Benefit Street. But\nMercy Dexter's once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious decay,\nso that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow voice and\ndisconcerting pallor--qualities shared to a singular degree by the one\nremaining servant Maria. In the autumn of 1782 Phebe Harris gave birth\nto a still-born daughter, and on the fifteenth of the next May Mercy\nDexter took leave of a useful, austere, and virtuous life.\n\nWilliam Harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically\nunhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and\nclosing it for ever. Securing temporary quarters for himself and his\nwife at the newly opened Golden Ball Inn, he arranged for the building\nof a new and finer house in Westminster Street, in the growing part of\nthe town across the Great Bridge. There, in 1785, his son Dutee was\nborn; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce\ndrove them back across the river and over the hill to Angell Street, in\nthe newer East Side residence district, where the late Archer Harris\nbuilt his sumptuous but hideous French-roofed mansion in 1876. William\nand Phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, but Dutee\nwas brought up by his cousin Rathbone Harris, Peleg's son.\n\nRathbone was a practical man, and rented the Benefit Street house\ndespite William's wish to keep it vacant. He considered it an obligation\nto his ward to make the most of all the boy's property, nor did he\nconcern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so many\nchanges of tenants, or the steadily growing aversion with which the\nhouse was generally regarded. It is likely that he felt only vexation\nwhen, in 1804, the town council ordered him to fumigate the place with\nsulfur, tar, and gum camphor on account of the much-discussed deaths of\nfour persons, presumably caused by the then diminishing fever epidemic.\nThey said the place had a febrile smell.\n\nDutee himself thought little of the house, for he grew up to be a\nprivateersman, and served with distinction on the _Vigilant_ under\nCaptain Cahoone in the War of 1812. He returned unharmed, married in\n1814, and became a father on that memorable night of September 23, 1815,\nwhen a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town, and\nfloated a tall sloop well up Westminster Street so that its masts almost\ntapped the Harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the new boy,\nWelcome, was a seaman's son.\n\nWelcome did not survive his father, but lived to perish gloriously at\nFredericksburg in 1862. Neither he nor his son Archer knew of the\nshunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to\nrent--perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odor of unkempt old\nage. Indeed, it never was rented after a series of deaths culminating in\n1861, which the excitement of the war tended to throw into obscurity.\nCarrington Harris, last of the male line, knew it only as a deserted and\nsomewhat picturesque center of legend until I told him my experience. He\nhad meant to tear it down and build an apartment house on the site, but\nafter my account decided to let it stand, install plumbing, and rent it.\nNor has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining tenants. The horror has\ngone.\n\n\n3\n\nIt may well be imagined how powerfully I was affected by the annals of\nthe Harrises. In this continuous record there seemed to me to brood a\npersistent evil beyond anything in nature as I had known it; an evil\nclearly connected with the house and not with the family. This\nimpression was confirmed by my uncle's less systematic array of\nmiscellaneous data--legends transcribed from servant gossip, cuttings\nfrom the papers, copies of death certificates by fellow-physicians, and\nthe like. All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was a\ntireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house;\nbut I may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their\nrecurrence through many reports from diverse sources. For example, the\nservant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungous\nand malodorous _cellar_ of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence.\nThere had been servants--Ann White especially--who would not use the\ncellar kitchen, and at least three well-defined legends bore upon the\nqueer quasi-human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree-roots and patches\nof mold in that region. These latter narratives interested me\nprofoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt that\nmost of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by\nadditions from the common stock of local ghost lore.\n\nAnn White, with her Exeter superstition, had promulgated the most\nextravagant and at the same time most consistent tale; alleging that\nthere must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires--the dead\nwho retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the\nliving--whose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spirits\nabroad by night. To destroy a vampire one must, the grandmothers say,\nexhume it and burn its heart, or at least drive a stake through that\norgan; and Ann's dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had been\nprominent in bringing about her discharge.\n\nHer tales, however, commanded a wide audience, and were the more readily\naccepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for burial\npurposes. To me their interest depended less on this circumstance than\non the peculiarly appropriate way in which they dovetailed with certain\nother things--the complaint of the departing servant Preserved Smith,\nwho had preceded Ann and never heard of her, that something \"sucked his\nbreath\" at night; the death-certificates of the fever victims of 1804,\nissued by Doctor Chad Hopkins, and showing the four deceased persons all\nunaccountably lacking in blood; and the obscure passages of poor Rhoby\nHarris's ravings, where she complained of the sharp teeth of a\nglassy-eyed, half-visible presence.\n\nFree from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced in\nme an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated\nnewspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house--one from the\n_Providence Gazette and Country-Journal_ of April 12, 1815, and the\nother from the _Daily Transcript and Chronicle_ of October 27,\n1845--each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose\nduplication was remarkable. It seems that in both instances the dying\nperson, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and in 1845 a\nschoolteacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured in\na horrible way, glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of\nthe attending physician. Even more puzzling, though, was the final case\nwhich put an end to the renting of the house--a series of anemia deaths\npreceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would craftily\nattempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wrist.\n\nThis was in 1860 and 1861, when my uncle had just begun his medical\npractise; and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his\nelder professional colleagues. The really inexplicable thing was the way\nin which the victims--ignorant people, for the ill-smelling and widely\nshunned house could now be rented to no others--would babble\nmaledictions in French, a language they could not possibly have studied\nto any extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby Harris nearly a century\nbefore, and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting historical\ndata on the house after listening, some time subsequent to his return\nfrom the war, to the first-hand account of Doctors Chase and Whitmarsh.\nIndeed, I could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject, and\nthat he was glad of my own interest--an open-minded and sympathetic\ninterest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which others\nwould merely have laughed. His fancy had not gone so far as mine, but he\nfelt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities, and\nworthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and\nmacabre.\n\nFor my part, I was disposed to take the whole subject with profound\nseriousness, and began at once not only to review the evidence, but to\naccumulate as much more as I could. I talked with the elderly Archer\nHarris, then owner of the house, many times before his death in 1916;\nand obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister Alice an\nauthentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected.\nWhen, however, I asked them what connection with France or its language\nthe house could have, they confessed themselves as frankly baffled and\nignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and all that Miss Harris could say\nwas that an old allusion her grandfather, Dutee Harris, had heard of\nmight have shed a little light. The old seaman, who had survived his son\nWelcome's death in battle by two years, had not himself known the\nlegend, but recalled that his earliest nurse, the ancient Maria Robbins,\nseemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird\nsignificance to the French raving of Rhoby Harris, which she had so\noften heard during the last days of that hapless woman. Maria had been\nat the shunned house from 1769 till the removal of the family in 1783,\nand had seen Mercy Dexter die. Once she hinted to the child Dutee of a\nsomewhat peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last moments, but he had soon\nforgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar. The\ngranddaughter, moreover, recalled even this much with difficulty. She\nand her brother were not so much interested in the house as was Archer's\nson Carrington, the present owner, with whom I talked after my\nexperience.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHaving exhausted the Harris family of all the information it could\nfurnish, I turned my attention to early town records and deeds with a\nzeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown in\nthe same work. What I wished was a comprehensive history of the site\nfrom its very settlement in 1636--or even before, if any Narragansett\nIndian legend could be unearthed to supply the data. I found, at the\nstart, that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot granted\noriginally to John Throckmorton; one of many similar strips beginning at\nthe Town Street beside the river and extending up over the hill to a\nline roughly corresponding with the modern Hope Street. The Throckmorton\nlot had later, of course, been much subdivided; and I became very\nassiduous in tracing that section through which Back or Benefit Street\nwas later run. It had, as rumor indeed said, been the Throckmorton\ngraveyard; but as I examined the records more carefully, I found that\nthe graves had all been transferred at an early date to the North Burial\nGround on the Pawtucket West Road.\n\nThen suddenly I came--by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in the\nmain body of records and might easily have been missed--upon something\nwhich aroused my keenest eagerness, fitting in as it did with several of\nthe queerest phases of the affair. It was the record of a lease, in\n1697, of a small tract of ground to an Etienne Roulet and wife. At last\nthe French element had appeared--that, and another deeper element of\nhorror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my weird\nand heterogeneous reading--and I feverishly studied the platting of the\nlocality as it had been before the cutting through and partial\nstraightening of Back Street between 1747 and 1758. I found what I had\nhalf expected, that where the shunned house now stood the Roulets had\nlaid out their graveyard behind a one-story and attic cottage, and that\nno record of any transfer of graves existed. The document, indeed, ended\nin much confusion; and I was forced to ransack both the Rhode Island\nHistorical Society and Shepley Library before I could find a local door\nwhich the name of Etienne Roulet would unlock. In the end I did find\nsomething; something of such vague but monstrous import that I set about\nat once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new and\nexcited minuteness.\n\nThe Roulets, it seemed, had come in 1696 from East Greenwich, down the\nwest shore of Narragansett Bay. They were Huguenots from Caude, and had\nencountered much opposition before the Providence selectmen allowed them\nto settle in the town. Unpopularity had dogged them in East Greenwich,\nwhither they had come in 1686, after the revocation of the Edict of\nNantes, and rumor said that the cause of dislike extended beyond mere\nracial and national prejudice, or the land disputes which involved other\nFrench settlers with the English in rivalries which not even Governor\nAndros could quell. But their ardent Protestantism--too ardent, some\nwhispered--and their evident distress when virtually driven from the\nvillage down the bay, had moved the sympathy of the town fathers. Here\nthe strangers had been granted a haven; and the swarthy Etienne Roulet,\nless apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer\ndiagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at Pardon\nTillinghast's wharf, far south in Town Street. There had, however, been\na riot of some sort later on--perhaps forty years later, after old\nRoulet's death--and no one seemed to hear of the family after that.\n\nFor a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been well\nremembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet\nlife of a New England seaport. Etienne's son Paul, a surly fellow whose\nerratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the\nfamily, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence\nnever shared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan neighbors, it was\nfreely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at\nthe proper time nor directed toward the proper object. All this had\nundoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins.\nWhat relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and other\ninhabitants of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alone\ncould determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the legends\nrealized that additional link with the terrible which my wider reading\nhad given me; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror which\ntells of the creature _Jacques Roulet, of Caude_, who in 1598 was\ncondemned to death as a demoniac but afterward saved from the stake by\nthe Paris parliament and shut in a madhouse. He had been found covered\nwith blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and\nrending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to lope away\nunhurt. Surely a pretty hearthside tale, with a queer significance as to\nname and place; but I decided that the Providence gossips could not have\ngenerally known of it. Had they known, the coincidence of names would\nhave brought some drastic and frightened action--indeed, might not its\nlimited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased the\nRoulets from the town?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the\nunwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of the\nbuilding, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor.\nFinally, with Carrington Harris's permission, I fitted a key to the\ndisused door opening from the cellar directly upon Benefit Street,\npreferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than the\ndark stairs, ground-floor hall, and front door could give. There, where\nmorbidity lurked most thickly, I searched and poked during long\nafternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbed\nabove-ground windows, and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked\ndoor which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside.\nNothing new rewarded my efforts--only the same depressing mustiness and\nfaint suggestions of noxious odors and nitrous outlines on the\nfloor--and I fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously\nthrough the broken panes.\n\nAt length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spot\nnocturnally; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch\nover the moldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted,\nhalf-phosphorescent fungi. The place had dispirited me curiously that\nevening, and I was almost prepared when I saw--or thought I saw--amidst\nthe whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the \"huddled\nform\" I had suspected from boyhood. Its clearness was astonishing and\nunprecedented--and as I watched I seemed to see again the thin,\nyellowish, shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainy\nafternoon so many years before.\n\nAbove the anthropomorphic patch of mold by the fireplace it rose; a\nsubtle, sickish, almost luminous vapor which as it hung trembling in the\ndampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form,\ngradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into the\nblackness of the great chimney with a fetor in its wake. It was truly\nhorrible, and the more so to me because of what I knew of the spot.\nRefusing to flee, I watched it fade--and as I watched I felt that it was\nin turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than visible.\nWhen I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tense\nhour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic decision. Weighing\nin his mind the importance of the matter, and the significance of our\nrelation to it, he insisted that we both test--and if possible\ndestroy--the horror of the house by a joint night or nights of\naggressive vigil in that musty and fungus-cursed cellar.\n\n\n4\n\nOn Wednesday, June 25, 1919, after a proper notification of Carrington\nHarris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find, my\nuncle and I conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a folding\ncamp cot, together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight and\nintricacy. These we placed in the cellar during the day, screening the\nwindows with paper and planning to return in the evening for our first\nvigil. We had locked the door from the cellar to the ground floor; and\nhaving a key to the outside cellar door, were prepared to leave our\nexpensive and delicate apparatus--which we had obtained secretly and at\ngreat cost--as many days as our vigils might be protracted. It was our\ndesign to sit up together till very late, and then watch singly till\ndawn in two-hour stretches, myself first and then my companion; the\ninactive member resting on the cot.\n\nThe natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments from\nthe laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armory, and\ninstinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a marvelous\ncommentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of\neighty-one. Elihu Whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws he\nhad preached as a physician, and but for what happened later would be\nhere in full vigor today. Only two persons suspected what did\nhappen--Carrington Harris and myself. I had to tell Harris because he\nowned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it. Then too,\nwe had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after my\nuncle's going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally\nnecessary public explanations. He turned very pale, but agreed to help\nme, and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house.\n\nTo declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching\nwould be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous. We were not, as I\nhave said, in any sense childishly superstitious, but scientific study\nand reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensions\nembraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance and\nenergy. In this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence from\nnumerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of certain\nforces of great power and, so far as the human point of view is\nconcerned, exceptional malignancy. To say that we actually believed in\nvampires or werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement. Rather\nmust it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility of\ncertain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and\nattenuated matter; existing very infrequently in three-dimensional space\nbecause of its more intimate connection with other spatial units, yet\nclose enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasional\nmanifestations which we, for lack of a proper vantage-point, may never\nhope to understand.\n\nIn short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array\nof facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house;\ntraceable to one or another of the ill-favored French settlers of two\ncenturies before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of\natomic and electronic motion. That the family of Roulet had possessed an\nabnormal affinity for outer circles of entity--dark spheres which for\nnormal folk hold only repulsion and terror--their recorded history\nseemed to prove. Had not, then, the riots of those bygone\nseventeen-thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid\nbrain of one or more of them--notably the sinister Paul Roulet--which\nobscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob, and\ncontinued to function in some multiple-dimensioned space along the\noriginal lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the\nencroaching community?\n\nSuch a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in\nthe light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity\nand intra-atomic action. One might easily imagine an alien nucleus of\nsubstance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible\nor immaterial subtractions from the life-force or bodily tissue and\nfluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates\nand with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself. It might be\nactively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of\nself-preservation. In any case such a monster must of necessity be in\nour scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose extirpation forms\na primary duty with every man not an enemy to the world's life, health,\nand sanity.\n\nWhat baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might\nencounter the thing. No sane person had ever seen it, and few had ever\nfelt it definitely. It might be pure energy--a form ethereal and outside\nthe realm of substance--or it might be partly material; some unknown and\nequivocal mass of plasticity, capable of changing at will to nebulous\napproximations of the solid, liquid, gaseous, or tenuously unparticled\nstates. The anthropomorphic patch of mold on the floor, the form of the\nyellowish vapor, and the curvature of the tree-roots in some of the old\ntales, all argued at least a remote and reminiscent connection with the\nhuman shape; but how representative or permanent that similarity might\nbe, none could say with any kind of certainty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted\nCrookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with\npeculiar screens and reflectors, in case it proved intangible and\nopposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair of\nmilitary flame-throwers of the sort used in the World War, in case it\nproved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction--for\nlike the superstitious Exeter rustics, we were prepared to burn the\nthing's heart out if heart existed to burn. All this aggressive\nmechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully arranged with\nreference to the cot and chairs, and to the spot before the fireplace\nwhere the mold had taken strange shapes. That suggestive patch, by the\nway, was only faintly visible when we placed our furniture and\ninstruments, and when we returned that evening for the actual vigil. For\na moment I half doubted that I had ever seen it in the more definitely\nlimned form--but then I thought of the legends.\n\nOur cellar vigil began at ten p. m., daylight saving time, and as it\ncontinued we found no promise of pertinent developments. A weak,\nfiltered glow from the rain-harassed street-lamps outside, and a feeble\nphosphorescence from the detestable fungi within, showed the dripping\nstone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished; the\ndank, fetid and mildew-tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi;\nthe rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, and\nother more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams of\nthe ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins and\nchambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircase\nwith ruined wooden hand-rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of\nblackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence\nof hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven--these\nthings, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricate\ndestructive machinery we had brought.\n\nWe had, as in my own former explorations, left the door to the street\nunlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open\nin case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with. It was our idea\nthat our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever malign\nentity lurked there; and that being prepared, we could dispose of the\nthing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we had\nrecognized and observed it sufficiently. How long it might require to\nevoke and extinguish the thing, we had no notion. It occurred to us,\ntoo, that our venture was far from safe; for in what strength the thing\nmight appear no one could tell. But we deemed the game worth the hazard,\nand embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly; conscious that the seeking\nof outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat our\nentire purpose. Such was our frame of mind as we talked--far into the\nnight, till my uncle's growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie down\nfor his two-hour sleep.\n\nSomething like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours\nalone--I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone;\nperhaps more alone than he can realize. My uncle breathed heavily, his\ndeep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside, and\npunctuated by another nerve-racking sound of distant dripping water\nwithin--for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather, and in\nthis storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose, antique masonry\nof the walls in the fungus-light and the feeble rays which stole in from\nthe street through the screened window; and once, when the noisome\natmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and\nlooked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights and\nmy nostrils on wholesome air. Still nothing occurred to reward my\nwatching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of\napprehension.\n\nThen the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had\nturned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the\nfirst hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity,\noccasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities\nof a choking moan.\n\nI turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted; so\nrising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the\nlight to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me most\nsurprisingly, considering its relative triviality. It must have been\nmerely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature\nof our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in\nitself frightful or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle's facial\nexpression, disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our\nsituation prompted, betrayed considerable agitation, and seemed not at\nall characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly and\nwell-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling\nwithin him. I think, on the whole, that it was this _variety_ which\nchiefly disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing\nperturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one but\nmany men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his\nmouth and teeth as he spoke. The words were at first indistinguishable,\nand then--with a tremendous start--I recognized something about them\nwhich filled me with icy fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle's\neducation and the interminable translations he had made from\nanthropological and antiquarian articles in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_.\nFor the venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering _in French_, and the few\nphrases I could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he\nhad ever adapted from the famous Paris magazine.\n\nSuddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper's forehead, and he\nleaped abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of French changed to a cry in\nEnglish, and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, \"My breath, my breath!\"\nThen the awakening became complete, and with a subsidence of facial\nexpression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began to\nrelate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise with a\nkind of awe.\n\nHe had, he said, floated off from a very ordinary series of\ndream-pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he\nhad ever read. It was of this world, and yet not of it--a shadowy\ngeometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar things\nin most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations. There was a suggestion\nof queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon another; an\narrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space seemed\ndissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion. In this kaleidoscopic\nvortex of phantasmal images were occasional snap-shots, if one might use\nthe term, of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneity.\n\nOnce my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit, with a crowd\nof angry faces framed by straggling locks and three-cornered hats\nfrowning down on him. Again he seemed to be in the interior of a\nhouse--an old house, apparently--but the details and inhabitants were\nconstantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the\nfurniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in\njust as great a state of flux as the presumably more mobile objects. It\nwas queer--damnably queer--and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if\nhalf expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange\nfaces many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris family. And\nall the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some\npervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought to\npossess itself of his vital processes.\n\nI shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were\nby eighty-one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknown\nforces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid;\nbut in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and that\nthese uncomfortable visions could be, at most, no more than my uncle's\nreaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled\nour minds to the exclusion of all else.\n\nConversation, also, soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; and\nin time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle\nseemed now very wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even though\nthe nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours.\n\nSleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the\nmost disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal\nloneness; with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where I\nlay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoing\nyells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood. My uncle's face\ncame to me with less pleasant association than in waking hours, and I\nrecall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a\npleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek\nwhich clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and\nstartled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out\nwith more than natural clearness and reality.\n\n\n5\n\nI had been lying with my face away from my uncle's chair, so that in\nthis sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the\nwindow, and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room,\nall photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light brighter\nthan the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside. It was\nnot a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong\nenough to read an average book by. But it cast a shadow of myself and\nthe cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, penetrating force that hinted\nat things more potent than luminosity. This I perceived with unhealthy\nsharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently\nassailed. For on my ears rang the reverberations of that shocking\nscream, while my nostrils revolted at the stench which filled the place.\nMy mind, as alert as my senses, recognized the gravely unusual; and\nalmost automatically I leaped up and turned about to grasp the\ndestructive instruments which we had left trained on the moldy spot\nbefore the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded what I was to see; for the\nscream had been in my uncle's voice, and I knew not against what menace\nI should have to defend him and myself.\n\nYet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are horrors\nbeyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable\nhideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few.\nOut of the fungus-ridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light,\nyellow and diseased, which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height in\nvague outlines half human and half monstrous, through which I could see\nthe chimney and fireplace beyond. It was all eyes--wolfish and\nmocking--and the rugose insect-like head dissolved at the top to a thin\nstream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up the\nchimney. I say that I saw this thing, but it is only in conscious\nretrospection that I ever definitely traced its damnable approach to\nform. At the time, it was to me only a seething, dimly phosphorescent\ncloud of fungous loathsomeness, enveloping and dissolving to an\nabhorrent plasticity the one object on which all my attention was\nfocussed. That object was my uncle--the venerable Elihu Whipple--who\nwith blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me, and\nreached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror had\nbrought.\n\nIt was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled\nmyself in preparation for the crucial moment, and blind training saved\nme. Recognizing the bubbling evil as no substance reachable by matter or\nmaterial chemistry, and therefore ignoring the flame-thrower which\nloomed on my left, I threw on the current of the Crookes tube apparatus,\nand focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness the strongest\nether radiations which man's art can arouse from the spaces and fluids\nof nature. There was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering, and the\nyellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes. But I saw the dimness\nwas only that of contrast, and that the waves from the machine had no\neffect whatever.\n\nThen, in the midst of that demoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horror\nwhich brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggering\ntoward that unlocked door to the quiet street, careless of what abnormal\nterrors I loosed upon the world, or what thoughts or judgments of men I\nbrought down upon my head. In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form\nof my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludes\nall description, and in which there played across his vanishing face\nsuch changes of identity as only madness can conceive. He was at once a\ndevil and a multitude, a charnel-house and a pageant. Lit by the mixed\nand uncertain beams, that gelatinous face assumed a dozen--a score--a\nhundred--aspects; grinning, as it sank to the ground on a body that\nmelted like tallow, in the caricatured likeness of legions strange and\nyet not strange.\n\nI saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult and\ninfantile, and other features old and young, coarse and refined,\nfamiliar and unfamiliar. For a second there flashed a degraded\ncounterfeit of a miniature of poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen in\nthe School of Design museum, and another time I thought I caught the\nraw-boned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a painting in\nCarrington Harris's house. It was frightful beyond conception; toward\nthe last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered\nclose to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was\nspreading, it seemed as though the shifting features fought against\nthemselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncle's kindly\nface. I like to think that he existed at that moment, and that he tried\nto bid me farewell. It seems to me I hiccupped a farewell from my own\nparched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin stream of grease\nfollowing me through the door to the rain-drenched sidewalk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rest is shadowy and monstrous. There was no one in the soaking\nstreet, and in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walked\naimlessly south past College Hill and the AthenÃ¦um, down Hopkins Street,\nand over the bridge to the business section where tall buildings seemed\nto guard me as modern material things guard the world from ancient and\nunwholesome wonder. Then gray dawn unfolded wetly from the east,\nsilhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples, and beckoning\nme to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished. And in the\nend I went, wet, hatless, and dazed in the morning light, and entered\nthat awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar, and which still\nswung cryptically in full sight of the early householders to whom I\ndared not speak.\n\nThe grease was gone, for the moldy floor was porous. And in front of the\nfireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled-up form traced in niter.\nI looked at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my neglected hat, and\nthe yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost, and I could\nscarcely recall what was dream and what was reality. Then thought\ntrickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible than\nI had dreamed.\n\nSitting down, I tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let me\njust what had happened, and how I might end the horror, if indeed it had\nbeen real. Matter it seemed not to be, nor ether, nor anything else\nconceivable by mortal mind. What, then, but some exotic _emanation_;\nsome vampirish vapor such as Exeter rustics tell of as lurking over\ncertain churchyards? This I felt was the clue, and again I looked at the\nfloor before the fireplace where the mold and niter had taken strange\nforms.\n\nIn ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for\nhome, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickax,\na spade, a military gas-mask, and six carboys of sulfuric acid, all to\nbe delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house in\nBenefit Street. After that I tried to sleep; and failing, passed the\nhours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract my\nmood.\n\nAt eleven a. m. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather,\nand I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the\nunknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling\nanybody. Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and because\nhe had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so little\ntoward belief. As I turned up the stinking black earth in front of the\nfireplace, my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from the\nwhite fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious thoughts of what\nI might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind,\nand this seemed to me one of them.\n\nMy hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in\nthe large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was\nabout six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of\nmy imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had cursed\nthe house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would look\nlike--what its form and substance would be, and how big it might have\nwaxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the\nhole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging the great carboys\nof acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty\nthem all down the aperture in quick succession. After that I dumped\nearth only along the other two sides; working more slowly and donning my\ngas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a\nnameless thing at the bottom of a pit.\n\nSuddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and\nmade a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as\nmy neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the\nlight of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was\nfishy and glassy--a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions\nof translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was\na rift where a part of the substance was folded over. The exposed area\nwas huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft blue-white\nstovepipe doubled in two, its largest part some two feet in diameter.\nStill more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and\naway from the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting the heavy\ncarboys, and precipitating their corrosive contents one after another\ndown that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality whose titan\n_elbow_ I had seen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow vapor which surged\ntempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended, will\nnever leave my memory. All along the hill people tell of the yellow day,\nwhen virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped in\nthe Providence River, but I know how mistaken they are as to the source.\nThey tell, too, of the hideous roar which at the same time came from\nsome disordered water-pipe or gas main underground--but again I could\ncorrect them if I dared. It was unspeakably shocking, and I do not see\nhow I lived through it. I did faint after emptying the fourth carboy,\nwhich I had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask;\nbut when I recovered I saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapors.\n\nThe two remaining carboys I emptied down without particular result, and\nafter a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. It\nwas twilight before I was done, but fear had gone out of the place. The\ndampness was less fetid, and all the strange fungi had withered to a\nkind of harmless grayish powder which blew ash-like along the floor. One\nof earth's nethermost terrors had perished for ever; and if there be a\nhell, it had received at last the demon soul of an unhallowed thing. And\nas I patted down the last spadeful of mold, I shed the first of the many\ntears with which I have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncle's\nmemory.\n\nThe next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in the\nshunned house's terraced garden, and shortly afterward Carrington Harris\nrented the place. It is still spectral, but its strangeness fascinates\nme, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn\ndown to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building. The\nbarren old trees in the yard have begun to bear small, sweet apples, and\nlast year the birds nested in their gnarled boughs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Weird Tales_ October 1937.

Human travel in outer space is threatened by strange creatures known as the Dragons. Imperceptible to ordinary people, Dragons are experienced as nothing but a sudden death or insanity. Dragons can only be destroyed by very strong light, but they move too fast for conventional defense methods. Both human and telepathic cats (who perceive the dragons as rats) are able to sense the creatures within milliseconds. The humans and cats work together as teams to protect interstellar spaceships traveling via planoforming (a type of faster than light speed travel). The cats ride outside of the spaceships in their own tiny crafts, waiting for the order from their human partner to attack. Pin-sets (telepathic amplifiers) heighten a telepathâs senses and allow the humans to communicate with their partner cats. The cats then destroy the Dragons with \"pinlights\", miniature nuclear bombs whose blast gives off pure visible radiance that can destroy the dragons. Thanks to the combination of the human mind and the cats' quick reactions, the battle against the Dragons is not only possible, but usually ends in victory.\nUnderhill, Woodley, Father Moontree, and a girl named West are the group of current telepaths fighting the war. The cats fighting alongside them are Captain Wow, Lady May and others. Woodley draws an unremarkable cat, West teams up with Captain Wow, Underhill with Lady May, and Father Moontree gets stuck with an old, unnamed, greedy male cat, who has the best fighting record of them all. While the Father Moontree and Woodley are not particularly interested in their partner cats, West thinks Captain Wow is cuddly, and Underhill has a strong connection with Lady May and enjoys being telepathically connected with her.\nThe team travel to the depths of space, searching for their enemy. During an attack, Underhill is unable to follow Lady Mayâs thoughts fast enough and the Dragon touches his mind, sending excruciating pain throughout his body. The battle lasts less than the blink of an eye, and the ship lands safely. Underhill is hospitalized and a doctor tells him that he was within a tenth of a millisecond of going insane, but the only thing that concerns Underhill is his partner, Lady May, and her well-being. A secretly jealous and angry nurse walks in and Underhill compares her to Lady May. Logically, he understands that Lady May is only a cat, but his mind tells him that no woman will ever equal her.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GAME OF RAT AND DRAGON ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Adam Buchbinder, and the\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Transcriber's Note:\n\n  This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1955.\n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\n\n\n\n                             The Game of\n\n                            Rat and Dragon\n\n\n\n                         By CORDWAINER SMITH\n\n\n\n             _Only partners could fight this deadliest of\n              wars--and the one way to dissolve the\n              partnership was to be personally dissolved!_\n\n\n\n                        Illustrated by HUNTER\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE TABLE\n\n\n\n\nPinlighting is a hell of a way to earn a living. Underhill was furious\nas he closed the door behind himself. It didn't make much sense to\nwear a uniform and look like a soldier if people didn't appreciate\nwhat you did.\n\nHe sat down in his chair, laid his head back in the headrest and\npulled the helmet down over his forehead.\n\nAs he waited for the pin-set to warm up, he remembered the girl in the\nouter corridor. She had looked at it, then looked at him scornfully.\n\n\"Meow.\" That was all she had said. Yet it had cut him like a knife.\n\nWhat did she think he was--a fool, a loafer, a uniformed nonentity?\nDidn't she know that for every half hour of pinlighting, he got a\nminimum of two months' recuperation in the hospital?\n\nBy now the set was warm. He felt the squares of space around him,\nsensed himself at the middle of an immense grid, a cubic grid, full\nof nothing. Out in that nothingness, he could sense the hollow aching\nhorror of space itself and could feel the terrible anxiety which his\nmind encountered whenever it met the faintest trace of inert dust.\n\nAs he relaxed, the comforting solidity of the Sun, the clock-work of\nthe familiar planets and the Moon rang in on him. Our own solar system\nwas as charming and as simple as an ancient cuckoo clock filled with\nfamiliar ticking and with reassuring noises. The odd little moons of\nMars swung around their planet like frantic mice, yet their regularity\nwas itself an assurance that all was well. Far above the plane of the\necliptic, he could feel half a ton of dust more or less drifting\noutside the lanes of human travel.\n\nHere there was nothing to fight, nothing to challenge the mind, to\ntear the living soul out of a body with its roots dripping in\neffluvium as tangible as blood.\n\nNothing ever moved in on the Solar System. He could wear the pin-set\nforever and be nothing more than a sort of telepathic astronomer, a\nman who could feel the hot, warm protection of the Sun throbbing and\nburning against his living mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWoodley came in.\n\n\"Same old ticking world,\" said Underhill. \"Nothing to report. No\nwonder they didn't develop the pin-set until they began to planoform.\nDown here with the hot Sun around us, it feels so good and so quiet.\nYou can feel everything spinning and turning. It's nice and sharp and\ncompact. It's sort of like sitting around home.\"\n\nWoodley grunted. He was not much given to flights of fantasy.\n\nUndeterred, Underhill went on, \"It must have been pretty good to have\nbeen an Ancient Man. I wonder why they burned up their world with war.\nThey didn't have to planoform. They didn't have to go out to earn\ntheir livings among the stars. They didn't have to dodge the Rats or\nplay the Game. They couldn't have invented pinlighting because they\ndidn't have any need of it, did they, Woodley?\"\n\nWoodley grunted, \"Uh-huh.\" Woodley was twenty-six years old and due to\nretire in one more year. He already had a farm picked out. He had\ngotten through ten years of hard work pinlighting with the best of\nthem. He had kept his sanity by not thinking very much about his job,\nmeeting the strains of the task whenever he had to meet them and\nthinking nothing more about his duties until the next emergency arose.\n\nWoodley never made a point of getting popular among the Partners.\nNone of the Partners liked him very much. Some of them even resented\nhim. He was suspected of thinking ugly thoughts of the Partners on\noccasion, but since none of the Partners ever thought a complaint in\narticulate form, the other pinlighters and the Chiefs of the\nInstrumentality left him alone.\n\nUnderhill was still full of the wonder of their job. Happily he\nbabbled on, \"What does happen to us when we planoform? Do you think\nit's sort of like dying? Did you ever see anybody who had his soul\npulled out?\"\n\n\"Pulling souls is just a way of talking about it,\" said Woodley.\n\"After all these years, nobody knows whether we have souls or not.\"\n\n\"But I saw one once. I saw what Dogwood looked like when he came\napart. There was something funny. It looked wet and sort of sticky as\nif it were bleeding and it went out of him--and you know what they did\nto Dogwood? They took him away, up in that part of the hospital where\nyou and I never go--way up at the top part where the others are, where\nthe others always have to go if they are alive after the Rats of the\nUp-and-Out have gotten them.\"\n\nWoodley sat down and lit an ancient pipe. He was burning something\ncalled tobacco in it. It was a dirty sort of habit, but it made him\nlook very dashing and adventurous.\n\n\"Look here, youngster. You don't have to worry about that stuff.\nPinlighting is getting better all the time. The Partners are getting\nbetter. I've seen them pinlight two Rats forty-six million miles apart\nin one and a half milliseconds. As long as people had to try to work\nthe pin-sets themselves, there was always the chance that with a\nminimum of four hundred milliseconds for the human mind to set a\npinlight, we wouldn't light the Rats up fast enough to protect our\nplanoforming ships. The Partners have changed all that. Once they get\ngoing, they're faster than Rats. And they always will be. I know it's\nnot easy, letting a Partner share your mind--\"\n\n\"It's not easy for them, either,\" said Underhill.\n\n\"Don't worry about them. They're not human. Let them take care of\nthemselves. I've seen more pinlighters go crazy from monkeying around\nwith Partners than I have ever seen caught by the Rats. How many do\nyou actually know of them that got grabbed by Rats?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderhill looked down at his fingers, which shone green and purple in\nthe vivid light thrown by the tuned-in pin-set, and counted ships.\nThe thumb for the _Andromeda_, lost with crew and passengers, the\nindex finger and the middle finger for _Release Ships_ 43 and 56,\nfound with their pin-sets burned out and every man, woman, and child\non board dead or insane. The ring finger, the little finger, and the\nthumb of the other hand were the first three battleships to be lost to\nthe Rats--lost as people realized that there was something out there\n_underneath space itself_ which was alive, capricious and malevolent.\n\nPlanoforming was sort of funny. It felt like like--\n\nLike nothing much.\n\nLike the twinge of a mild electric shock.\n\nLike the ache of a sore tooth bitten on for the first time.\n\nLike a slightly painful flash of light against the eyes.\n\nYet in that time, a forty-thousand-ton ship lifting free above Earth\ndisappeared somehow or other into two dimensions and appeared half a\nlight-year or fifty light-years off.\n\nAt one moment, he would be sitting in the Fighting Room, the pin-set\nready and the familiar Solar System ticking around inside his head.\nFor a second or a year (he could never tell how long it really was,\nsubjectively), the funny little flash went through him and then he was\nloose in the Up-and-Out, the terrible open spaces between the stars,\nwhere the stars themselves felt like pimples on his telepathic mind\nand the planets were too far away to be sensed or read.\n\nSomewhere in this outer space, a gruesome death awaited, death and\nhorror of a kind which Man had never encountered until he reached out\nfor inter-stellar space itself. Apparently the light of the suns kept\nthe Dragons away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDragons. That was what people called them. To ordinary people, there\nwas nothing, nothing except the shiver of planoforming and the hammer\nblow of sudden death or the dark spastic note of lunacy descending\ninto their minds.\n\nBut to the telepaths, they were Dragons.\n\nIn the fraction of a second between the telepaths' awareness of a\nhostile something out in the black, hollow nothingness of space and\nthe impact of a ferocious, ruinous psychic blow against all living\nthings within the ship, the telepaths had sensed entities something\nlike the Dragons of ancient human lore, beasts more clever than\nbeasts, demons more tangible than demons, hungry vortices of aliveness\nand hate compounded by unknown means out of the thin tenuous matter\nbetween the stars.\n\nIt took a surviving ship to bring back the news--a ship in which, by\nsheer chance, a telepath had a light beam ready, turning it out at the\ninnocent dust so that, within the panorama of his mind, the Dragon\ndissolved into nothing at all and the other passengers, themselves\nnon-telepathic, went about their way not realizing that their own\nimmediate deaths had been averted.\n\nFrom then on, it was easy--almost.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPlanoforming ships always carried telepaths. Telepaths had their\nsensitiveness enlarged to an immense range by the pin-sets, which were\ntelepathic amplifiers adapted to the mammal mind. The pin-sets in turn\nwere electronically geared into small dirigible light bombs. Light did\nit.\n\nLight broke up the Dragons, allowed the ships to reform\nthree-dimensionally, skip, skip, skip, as they moved from star to\nstar.\n\nThe odds suddenly moved down from a hundred to one against mankind to\nsixty to forty in mankind's favor.\n\nThis was not enough. The telepaths were trained to become\nultrasensitive, trained to become aware of the Dragons in less than a\nmillisecond.\n\nBut it was found that the Dragons could move a million miles in just\nunder two milliseconds and that this was not enough for the human mind\nto activate the light beams.\n\nAttempts had been made to sheath the ships in light at all times.\n\nThis defense wore out.\n\nAs mankind learned about the Dragons, so too, apparently, the Dragons\nlearned about mankind. Somehow they flattened their own bulk and came\nin on extremely flat trajectories very quickly.\n\nIntense light was needed, light of sunlike intensity. This could be\nprovided only by light bombs. Pinlighting came into existence.\n\nPinlighting consisted of the detonation of ultra-vivid miniature\nphotonuclear bombs, which converted a few ounces of a magnesium\nisotope into pure visible radiance.\n\nThe odds kept coming down in mankind's favor, yet ships were being\nlost.\n\nIt became so bad that people didn't even want to find the ships\nbecause the rescuers knew what they would see. It was sad to bring\nback to Earth three hundred bodies ready for burial and two hundred or\nthree hundred lunatics, damaged beyond repair, to be wakened, and fed,\nand cleaned, and put to sleep, wakened and fed again until their lives\nwere ended.\n\n\n\nTelepaths tried to reach into the minds of the psychotics who had been\ndamaged by the Dragons, but they found nothing there beyond vivid\nspouting columns of fiery terror bursting from the primordial id\nitself, the volcanic source of life.\n\nThen came the Partners.\n\nMan and Partner could do together what Man could not do alone. Men had\nthe intellect. Partners had the speed.\n\nThe Partners rode their tiny craft, no larger than footballs, outside\nthe spaceships. They planoformed with the ships. They rode beside them\nin their six-pound craft ready to attack.\n\nThe tiny ships of the Partners were swift. Each carried a dozen\npinlights, bombs no bigger than thimbles.\n\nThe pinlighters threw the Partners--quite literally threw--by means of\nmind-to-firing relays direct at the Dragons.\n\nWhat seemed to be Dragons to the human mind appeared in the form of\ngigantic Rats in the minds of the Partners.\n\nOut in the pitiless nothingness of space, the Partners' minds\nresponded to an instinct as old as life. The Partners attacked,\nstriking with a speed faster than Man's, going from attack to attack\nuntil the Rats or themselves were destroyed. Almost all the time, it\nwas the Partners who won.\n\nWith the safety of the inter-stellar skip, skip, skip of the ships,\ncommerce increased immensely, the population of all the colonies went\nup, and the demand for trained Partners increased.\n\nUnderhill and Woodley were a part of the third generation of\npinlighters and yet, to them, it seemed as though their craft had\nendured forever.\n\n\n\nGearing space into minds by means of the pin-set, adding the Partners\nto those minds, keying up the mind for the tension of a fight on which\nall depended--this was more than human synapses could stand for long.\nUnderhill needed his two months' rest after half an hour of fighting.\nWoodley needed his retirement after ten years of service. They were\nyoung. They were good. But they had limitations.\n\nSo much depended on the choice of Partners, so much on the sheer luck\nof who drew whom.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHUFFLE\n\n\nFather Moontree and the little girl named West entered the room. They\nwere the other two pinlighters. The human complement of the Fighting\nRoom was now complete.\n\nFather Moontree was a red-faced man of forty-five who had lived the\npeaceful life of a farmer until he reached his fortieth year. Only\nthen, belatedly, did the authorities find he was telepathic and agree\nto let him late in life enter upon the career of pinlighter. He did\nwell at it, but he was fantastically old for this kind of business.\n\nFather Moontree looked at the glum Woodley and the musing Underhill.\n\"How're the youngsters today? Ready for a good fight?\"\n\n\"Father always wants a fight,\" giggled the little girl named West. She\nwas such a little little girl. Her giggle was high and childish. She\nlooked like the last person in the world one would expect to find in\nthe rough, sharp dueling of pinlighting.\n\nUnderhill had been amused one time when he found one of the most\nsluggish of the Partners coming away happy from contact with the mind\nof the girl named West.\n\nUsually the Partners didn't care much about the human minds with which\nthey were paired for the journey. The Partners seemed to take the\nattitude that human minds were complex and fouled up beyond belief,\nanyhow. No Partner ever questioned the superiority of the human mind,\nthough very few of the Partners were much impressed by that\nsuperiority.\n\nThe Partners liked people. They were willing to fight with them. They\nwere even willing to die for them. But when a Partner liked an\nindividual the way, for example, that Captain Wow or the Lady May\nliked Underhill, the liking had nothing to do with intellect. It was a\nmatter of temperament, of feel.\n\nUnderhill knew perfectly well that Captain Wow regarded his,\nUnderhill's, brains as silly. What Captain Wow liked was Underhill's\nfriendly emotional structure, the cheerfulness and glint of wicked\namusement that shot through Underhill's unconscious thought patterns,\nand the gaiety with which Underhill faced danger. The words, the\nhistory books, the ideas, the science--Underhill could sense all that\nin his own mind, reflected back from Captain Wow's mind, as so much\nrubbish.\n\nMiss West looked at Underhill. \"I bet you've put stickum on the\nstones.\"\n\n\"I did not!\"\n\nUnderhill felt his ears grow red with embarrassment. During his\nnovitiate, he had tried to cheat in the lottery because he got\nparticularly fond of a special Partner, a lovely young mother named\nMurr. It was so much easier to operate with Murr and she was so\naffectionate toward him that he forgot pinlighting was hard work and\nthat he was not instructed to have a good time with his Partner. They\nwere both designed and prepared to go into deadly battle together.\n\nOne cheating had been enough. They had found him out and he had been\nlaughed at for years.\n\nFather Moontree picked up the imitation-leather cup and shook the\nstone dice which assigned them their Partners for the trip. By senior\nrights, he took first draw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe grimaced. He had drawn a greedy old character, a tough old male\nwhose mind was full of slobbering thoughts of food, veritable oceans\nfull of half-spoiled fish. Father Moontree had once said that he\nburped cod liver oil for weeks after drawing that particular glutton,\nso strongly had the telepathic image of fish impressed itself upon his\nmind. Yet the glutton was a glutton for danger as well as for fish. He\nhad killed sixty-three Dragons, more than any other Partner in the\nservice, and was quite literally worth his weight in gold.\n\nThe little girl West came next. She drew Captain Wow. When she saw who\nit was, she smiled.\n\n\"I _like_ him,\" she said. \"He's such fun to fight with. He feels so\nnice and cuddly in my mind.\"\n\n\"Cuddly, hell,\" said Woodley. \"I've been in his mind, too. It's the\nmost leering mind in this ship, bar none.\"\n\n\"Nasty man,\" said the little girl. She said it declaratively, without\nreproach.\n\nUnderhill, looking at her, shivered.\n\nHe didn't see how she could take Captain Wow so calmly. Captain Wow's\nmind _did_ leer. When Captain Wow got excited in the middle of a\nbattle, confused images of Dragons, deadly Rats, luscious beds, the\nsmell of fish, and the shock of space all scrambled together in his\nmind as he and Captain Wow, their consciousnesses linked together\nthrough the pin-set, became a fantastic composite of human being and\nPersian cat.\n\nThat's the trouble with working with cats, thought Underhill. It's a\npity that nothing else anywhere will serve as Partner. Cats were all\nright once you got in touch with them telepathically. They were smart\nenough to meet the needs of the fight, but their motives and desires\nwere certainly different from those of humans.\n\nThey were companionable enough as long as you thought tangible images\nat them, but their minds just closed up and went to sleep when you\nrecited Shakespeare or Colegrove, or if you tried to tell them what\nspace was.\n\nIt was sort of funny realizing that the Partners who were so grim and\nmature out here in space were the same cute little animals that people\nhad used as pets for thousands of years back on Earth. He had\nembarrassed himself more than once while on the ground saluting\nperfectly ordinary non-telepathic cats because he had forgotten for\nthe moment that they were not Partners.\n\nHe picked up the cup and shook out his stone dice.\n\nHe was lucky--he drew the Lady May.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Lady May was the most thoughtful Partner he had ever met. In her,\nthe finely bred pedigree mind of a Persian cat had reached one of its\nhighest peaks of development. She was more complex than any human\nwoman, but the complexity was all one of emotions, memory, hope and\ndiscriminated experience--experience sorted through without benefit of\nwords.\n\nWhen he had first come into contact with her mind, he was astonished at\nits clarity. With her he remembered her kittenhood. He remembered every\nmating experience she had ever had. He saw in a half-recognizable\ngallery all the other pinlighters with whom she had been paired for the\nfight. And he saw himself radiant, cheerful and desirable.\n\nHe even thought he caught the edge of a longing--\n\nA very flattering and yearning thought: _What a pity he is not a cat._\n\nWoodley picked up the last stone. He drew what he deserved--a sullen,\nscared old tomcat with none of the verve of Captain Wow. Woodley's\nPartner was the most animal of all the cats on the ship, a low,\nbrutish type with a dull mind. Even telepathy had not refined his\ncharacter. His ears were half chewed off from the first fights in\nwhich he had engaged.\n\nHe was a serviceable fighter, nothing more.\n\nWoodley grunted.\n\nUnderhill glanced at him oddly. Didn't Woodley ever do anything but\ngrunt?\n\nFather Moontree looked at the other three. \"You might as well get your\nPartners now. I'll let the Scanner know we're ready to go into the\nUp-and-Out.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEAL\n\n\nUnderhill spun the combination lock on the Lady May's cage. He woke\nher gently and took her into his arms. She humped her back\nluxuriously, stretched her claws, started to purr, thought better of\nit, and licked him on the wrist instead. He did not have the pin-set\non, so their minds were closed to each other, but in the angle of her\nmustache and in the movement of her ears, he caught some sense of\ngratification she experienced in finding him as her Partner.\n\nHe talked to her in human speech, even though speech meant nothing to\na cat when the pin-set was not on.\n\n\"It's a damn shame, sending a sweet little thing like you whirling\naround in the coldness of nothing to hunt for Rats that are bigger and\ndeadlier than all of us put together. You didn't ask for this kind of\nfight, did you?\"\n\nFor answer, she licked his hand, purred, tickled his cheek with her\nlong fluffy tail, turned around and faced him, golden eyes shining.\n\nFor a moment, they stared at each other, man squatting, cat standing\nerect on her hind legs, front claws digging into his knee. Human eyes\nand cat eyes looked across an immensity which no words could meet, but\nwhich affection spanned in a single glance.\n\n\"Time to get in,\" he said.\n\nShe walked docilely into her spheroid carrier. She climbed in. He saw\nto it that her miniature pin-set rested firmly and comfortably against\nthe base of her brain. He made sure that her claws were padded so that\nshe could not tear herself in the excitement of battle.\n\nSoftly he said to her, \"Ready?\"\n\nFor answer, she preened her back as much as her harness would permit\nand purred softly within the confines of the frame that held her.\n\nHe slapped down the lid and watched the sealant ooze around the seam.\nFor a few hours, she was welded into her projectile until a workman\nwith a short cutting arc would remove her after she had done her duty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe picked up the entire projectile and slipped it into the ejection\ntube. He closed the door of the tube, spun the lock, seated himself in\nhis chair, and put his own pin-set on.\n\nOnce again he flung the switch.\n\nHe sat in a small room, _small_, _small_, _warm_, _warm_, the bodies\nof the other three people moving close around him, the tangible lights\nin the ceiling bright and heavy against his closed eyelids.\n\nAs the pin-set warmed, the room fell away. The other people ceased to\nbe people and became small glowing heaps of fire, embers, dark red\nfire, with the consciousness of life burning like old red coals in a\ncountry fireplace.\n\nAs the pin-set warmed a little more, he felt Earth just below him,\nfelt the ship slipping away, felt the turning Moon as it swung on the\nfar side of the world, felt the planets and the hot, clear goodness of\nthe Sun which kept the Dragons so far from mankind's native ground.\n\nFinally, he reached complete awareness.\n\nHe was telepathically alive to a range of millions of miles. He felt\nthe dust which he had noticed earlier high above the ecliptic. With a\nthrill of warmth and tenderness, he felt the consciousness of the Lady\nMay pouring over into his own. Her consciousness was as gentle and\nclear and yet sharp to the taste of his mind as if it were scented\noil. It felt relaxing and reassuring. He could sense her welcome of\nhim. It was scarcely a thought, just a raw emotion of greeting.\n\nAt last they were one again.\n\nIn a tiny remote corner of his mind, as tiny as the smallest toy he\nhad ever seen in his childhood, he was still aware of the room and the\nship, and of Father Moontree picking up a telephone and speaking to a\nScanner captain in charge of the ship.\n\nHis telepathic mind caught the idea long before his ears could frame\nthe words. The actual sound followed the idea the way that thunder on\nan ocean beach follows the lightning inward from far out over the\nseas.\n\n\"The Fighting Room is ready. Clear to planoform, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PLAY\n\n\nUnderhill was always a little exasperated the way that Lady May\nexperienced things before he did.\n\nHe was braced for the quick vinegar thrill of planoforming, but he\ncaught her report of it before his own nerves could register what\nhappened.\n\nEarth had fallen so far away that he groped for several milliseconds\nbefore he found the Sun in the upper rear right-hand corner of his\ntelepathic mind.\n\nThat was a good jump, he thought. This way we'll get there in four or\nfive skips.\n\nA few hundred miles outside the ship, the Lady May thought back at\nhim, \"O warm, O generous, O gigantic man! O brave, O friendly, O\ntender and huge Partner! O wonderful with you, with you so good, good,\ngood, warm, warm, now to fight, now to go, good with you....\"\n\nHe knew that she was not thinking words, that his mind took the clear\namiable babble of her cat intellect and translated it into images\nwhich his own thinking could record and understand.\n\nNeither one of them was absorbed in the game of mutual greetings. He\nreached out far beyond her range of perception to see if there was\nanything near the ship. It was funny how it was possible to do two\nthings at once. He could scan space with his pin-set mind and yet at\nthe same time catch a vagrant thought of hers, a lovely, affectionate\nthought about a son who had had a golden face and a chest covered with\nsoft, incredibly downy white fur.\n\nWhile he was still searching, he caught the warning from her.\n\n_We jump again!_\n\nAnd so they had. The ship had moved to a second planoform. The stars\nwere different. The Sun was immeasurably far behind. Even the nearest\nstars were barely in contact. This was good Dragon country, this open,\nnasty, hollow kind of space. He reached farther, faster, sensing and\nlooking for danger, ready to fling the Lady May at danger wherever he\nfound it.\n\nTerror blazed up in his mind, so sharp, so clear, that it came through\nas a physical wrench.\n\nThe little girl named West had found something--something immense,\nlong, black, sharp, greedy, horrific. She flung Captain Wow at it.\n\nUnderhill tried to keep his own mind clear. \"Watch out!\" he shouted\ntelepathically at the others, trying to move the Lady May around.\n\nAt one corner of the battle, he felt the lustful rage of Captain Wow\nas the big Persian tomcat detonated lights while he approached the\nstreak of dust which threatened the ship and the people within.\n\nThe lights scored near-misses.\n\nThe dust flattened itself, changing from the shape of a sting-ray into\nthe shape of a spear.\n\nNot three milliseconds had elapsed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFather Moontree was talking human words and was saying in a voice that\nmoved like cold molasses out of a heavy jar, \"C-A-P-T-A-I-N.\"\nUnderhill knew that the sentence was going to be \"Captain, move fast!\"\n\nThe battle would be fought and finished before Father Moontree got\nthrough talking.\n\nNow, fractions of a millisecond later, the Lady May was directly in\nline.\n\nHere was where the skill and speed of the Partners came in. She could\nreact faster than he. She could see the threat as an immense Rat\ncoming direct at her.\n\nShe could fire the light-bombs with a discrimination which he might\nmiss.\n\nHe was connected with her mind, but he could not follow it.\n\nHis consciousness absorbed the tearing wound inflicted by the alien\nenemy. It was like no wound on Earth--raw, crazy pain which started\nlike a burn at his navel. He began to writhe in his chair.\n\nActually he had not yet had time to move a muscle when the Lady May\nstruck back at their enemy.\n\nFive evenly spaced photonuclear bombs blazed out across a hundred\nthousand miles.\n\nThe pain in his mind and body vanished.\n\n\n\nHe felt a moment of fierce, terrible, feral elation running through\nthe mind of the Lady May as she finished her kill. It was always\ndisappointing to the cats to find out that their enemies whom they\nsensed as gigantic space Rats disappeared at the moment of\ndestruction.\n\nThen he felt her hurt, the pain and the fear that swept over both of\nthem as the battle, quicker than the movement of an eyelid, had come\nand gone. In the same instant, there came the sharp and acid twinge\nof planoform.\n\nOnce more the ship went skip.\n\nHe could hear Woodley thinking at him. \"You don't have to bother much.\nThis old son of a gun and I will take over for a while.\"\n\nTwice again the twinge, the skip.\n\nHe had no idea where he was until the lights of the Caledonia space\nboard shone below.\n\n\n\nWith a weariness that lay almost beyond the limits of thought, he\nthrew his mind back into rapport with the pin-set, fixing the Lady\nMay's projectile gently and neatly in its launching tube.\n\nShe was half dead with fatigue, but he could feel the beat of her\nheart, could listen to her panting, and he grasped the grateful edge\nof a thanks reaching from her mind to his.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SCORE\n\n\nThey put him in the hospital at Caledonia.\n\nThe doctor was friendly but firm. \"You actually got touched by that\nDragon. That's as close a shave as I've ever seen. It's all so quick\nthat it'll be a long time before we know what happened scientifically,\nbut I suppose you'd be ready for the insane asylum now if the contact\nhad lasted several tenths of a millisecond longer. What kind of cat\ndid you have out in front of you?\"\n\nUnderhill felt the words coming out of him slowly. Words were such a\nlot of trouble compared with the speed and the joy of thinking, fast\nand sharp and clear, mind to mind! But words were all that could reach\nordinary people like this doctor.\n\nHis mouth moved heavily as he articulated words, \"Don't call our\nPartners cats. The right thing to call them is Partners. They fight\nfor us in a team. You ought to know we call them Partners, not cats.\nHow is mine?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the doctor contritely. \"We'll find out for you.\nMeanwhile, old man, you take it easy. There's nothing but rest that\ncan help you. Can you make yourself sleep, or would you like us to\ngive you some kind of sedative?\"\n\n\"I can sleep,\" said Underhill. \"I just want to know about the Lady\nMay.\"\n\nThe nurse joined in. She was a little antagonistic. \"Don't you want to\nknow about the other people?\"\n\n\"They're okay,\" said Underhill. \"I knew that before I came in here.\"\n\nHe stretched his arms and sighed and grinned at them. He could see\nthey were relaxing and were beginning to treat him as a person instead\nof a patient.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he said. \"Just let me know when I can go see my\nPartner.\"\n\nA new thought struck him. He looked wildly at the doctor. \"They didn't\nsend her off with the ship, did they?\"\n\n\"I'll find out right away,\" said the doctor. He gave Underhill a\nreassuring squeeze of the shoulder and left the room.\n\nThe nurse took a napkin off a goblet of chilled fruit juice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderhill tried to smile at her. There seemed to be something wrong\nwith the girl. He wished she would go away. First she had started to\nbe friendly and now she was distant again. It's a nuisance being\ntelepathic, he thought. You keep trying to reach even when you are not\nmaking contact.\n\nSuddenly she swung around on him.\n\n\"You pinlighters! You and your damn cats!\"\n\nJust as she stamped out, he burst into her mind. He saw himself a\nradiant hero, clad in his smooth suede uniform, the pin-set crown\nshining like ancient royal jewels around his head. He saw his own\nface, handsome and masculine, shining out of her mind. He saw himself\nvery far away and he saw himself as she hated him.\n\nShe hated him in the secrecy of her own mind. She hated him because he\nwas--she thought--proud, and strange, and rich, better and more\nbeautiful than people like her.\n\nHe cut off the sight of her mind and, as he buried his face in the\npillow, he caught an image of the Lady May.\n\n\"She _is_ a cat,\" he thought. \"That's all she is--a _cat_!\"\n\nBut that was not how his mind saw her--quick beyond all dreams of\nspeed, sharp, clever, unbelievably graceful, beautiful, wordless and\nundemanding.\n\nWhere would he ever find a woman who could compare with her?\n\n--CORDWAINER SMITH\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Game of Rat and Dragon, by Cordwainer Smith"}

It is not a connected narrative, though it can be read as an allegory of a heart's journey through life. The \"I\" of the poems, the authorial person, is in two cases named as Terence (VIII, LXII), the \"Shropshire Lad\" of the title. However, the poems are not all in the same voice and the stories they tell are not intended as a single coherent narrative.\nThe collection begins by paying tribute to the Shropshire lads who have died as soldiers in the service of Queen Victoria, as her golden jubilee (1887) is celebrated with a beacon bonfire at Clee (I). There is little time for a lad to live and enjoy the spring (II). Death awaits the soldier (III-IV). Maids are not always kind (V-VI) and the farmer also comes to the grave (VII). Some lads murder their brothers and are hanged (VIII-IX). Love may be unrequited (X). A dead lad's ghost begs the consolation of a last embrace (XI). Unattainable love leaves the lad helpless and lost (XIII-XVI). The playing of a game of cricket or football consoles a broken heart (XVII).\nThe athlete who died young was lucky, for he did not outlive his renown (XIX). The poet exchanges a glance with a marching soldier and wishes him well, though thinking they will never cross paths again (XXII). He envies the country lads who die young and do not grow old (XXIII). Quick, while he is alive and young, allow him to work beside you! (XXIV). A lover may die, and his girl will walk out with another (XXV-XXVII). The hostility of the ancient Saxon and Briton are in his blood, and he owes his life to violence and rape (XXVIII). The storm on Wenlock Edge symbolizes the same turmoil in his soul as the Romans knew at Wroxeter (XXXI). He is here but for a moment â take this hand! (XXXII) But if he is of no use to them that he loves, he will go away, perhaps to be a soldier (XXXIV, XXXV). Or one may live an exile from home in London, but without forgetting home and friends (XXXVII, XXXVIII).\nThe wind sighs across England to him from Shropshire, but he will not see the broom flowering gold on Wenlock Edge (XXXVIII-XL). London is full of cold-hearted men who fear and hate one other, but he will make the best of life while he has a living will (XLIII). The suicide is wise, for he prefers to die cleanly than live in shame (XLIV). Bring him no flowers, but only what will never flower again (XLVI). A carpenter's son once died on the gallows, so that other lads might live (XLVII). He was happy before he was born, but he will endure life for a while: the cure for all sorrows will come in time (XLVIII). If crowded and noisy London has its troubles, so do quiet Clun and Knighton, and the only cure for any of them is the grave (L).\nThough he is in London, his spirit wanders about his home fields (LII). From the unquiet grave the suicide's ghost visits the beloved (LIII). Those he loved are dead, and other youths eternally re-live his own experiences (LV). Like the lad that becomes a soldier, one can choose death and face it (LVI). Dick is in the graveyard, and Ned is long in jail, as he comes home to Ludlow (LVIII). Take your pack and go: death will be a journey into eternal night (LX). It matters not if he sleeps among the suicides, or among those who died well â they were all his friends(LXI). Do you mock his melancholy thoughts? He has used them like the poisons sampled by Mithridates, and shall die old (LXII). Perhaps these poems are not fashionable, but they will always please other lads like him (LXIII).", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK A SHROPSHIRE LAD ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Albert Imrie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA SHROPSHIRE LAD\n\nBy A. E. Housman\n\nIntroduction by William Stanley Braithwaite\n\n1919\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe method of the poems in _ A Shropshire Lad _ illustrates better\nthan any theory how poetry may assume the attire of reality, and yet\nin speech of the simplest, become in spirit the sheer quality of\nloveliness. For, in these unobtrusive pages, there is nothing shunned\nwhich makes the spectacle of life parade its dark and painful, its\nironic and cynical burdens, as well as those images with happy and\nexquisite aspects. With a broader and deeper background of experience\nand environment, which by some divine special privilege belongs to\nthe poetic imagination, it is easier to set apart and contrast these\nopposing words and sympathies in a poet; but here we find them evoked\nin a restricted locale- an English county-where the rich, cool tranquil\nlandscape gives a solid texture to the human show. What, I think,\nimpresses one, thrills, like ecstatic, half-smothered strains of music,\nfloating from unperceived instruments, in Mr. Housman's poems, is\nthe encounter his spirit constantly endures with life. It is, this\nencounter, what you feel in the Greeks, and as in the Greeks, it is a\nspiritual waging of miraculous forces. There is, too, in Mr. Housman's\npoems, the singularly Grecian Quality of a clean and fragrant mental and\nemotional temper, vibrating equally whether the theme dealt with is\nruin or defeat, or some great tragic crisis of spirit, or with moods and\nardours of pure enjoyment and simplicities of feeling. Scarcely has any\nmodern book of poems shown so sure a touch of genius in this respect:\nthe magic, in a continuous glow saturating the substance of every\npicture and motive with its own peculiar essence.\n\nWhat has been called the \"cynical bitterness\" of Mr. Housman's poems,\nis really nothing more than his ability to etch in sharp tones the\nactualities of experience. The poet himself is never cynical; his\njoyousness is all too apparent in the very manner and intensity of\nexpression. The \"lads\" of Ludlow are so human to him, the hawthorn and\nbroom on the Severn shores are so fragrant with associations, he cannot\nhelp but compose under a kind of imaginative wizardry of exultation,\neven when the immediate subject is grim or grotesque. In many of\nthese brief, tense poems the reader confronts a mask, as it were, with\nappalling and distorted lineaments; but behind it the poet smiles,\nperhaps sardonically, but smiles nevertheless. In the real countenance\nthere are no tears or grievances, but a quizzical, humorous expression\nwhich shows, when one has torn the subterfuge away, that here is a\nspirit whom life may menace with its contradictions and fatalities, but\nnever dupe with its circumstance and mystery.\n\nAll this quite points to, and partly explains, the charm of the poems in\n_ A Shropshire Lad _. The fastidious care with which each poem is built\nout of the simplest of technical elements, the precise tone and color of\nlanguage employed to articulate impulse and mood, and the reproduction\nof objective substances for a clear visualization of character and\nscene, all tend by a sure and unfaltering composition, to present a\nlyric art unique in English poetry of the last twenty-five years.\n\nI dare say I have scarcely touched upon the secret of Mr. Housman's\nbook. For some it may radiate from the Shropshire life he so finely\netches; for others, in the vivid artistic simplicity and unity of\nvalues, through which Shropshire lads and landscapes are presented. It\nmust be, however, in the miraculous fusing of the two. Whatever that\nsecret is, the charm of it never fails after all these years to keep the\npoems preserved with a freshness and vitality, which are the qualities\nof enduring genius.\n\n\nWILLIAM STANLEY BRAITHWAITE\n\n\n\n\n\nA SHROPSHIRE LAD\n\n\n\n          I\n\n          1887\n\n          From Clee to heaven the beacon burns,\n           The shires have seen it plain,\n          From north and south the sign returns\n           And beacons burn again.\n\n          Look left, look right, the hills are bright,\n           The dales are light between,\n          Because 'tis fifty years to-night\n           That God has saved the Queen.\n\n          Now, when the flame they watch not towers\n           About the soil they trod,\n          Lads, we'll remember friends of ours\n           Who shared the work with God.\n\n          To skies that knit their heartstrings right,\n           To fields that bred them brave,\n          The saviours come not home to-night:\n           Themselves they could not save.\n\n          It dawns in Asia, tombstones show\n           And Shropshire names are read;\n          And the Nile spills his overflow\n           Beside the Severn's dead.\n\n          We pledge in peace by farm and town\n           The Queen they served in war,\n          And fire the beacons up and down\n           The land they perished for.\n\n          \"God Save the Queen\" we living sing,\n           From height to height 'tis heard;\n          And with the rest your voices ring,\n           Lads of the Fifty-third.\n\n          Oh, God will save her, fear you not:\n           Be you the men you've been,\n          Get you the sons your fathers got,\n           And God will Save the Queen.\n\n\n\n          II\n\n          Loveliest of trees, the cherry now\n          Is hung with bloom along the bough,\n          And stands about the woodland ride\n          Wearing white for Eastertide.\n\n          Now, of my threescore years and ten,\n          Twenty will not come again,\n          And take from seventy springs a score,\n          It only leaves me fifty more.\n\n          And since to look at things in bloom\n          Fifty springs are little room,\n          About the woodlands I will go\n          To see the cherry hung with snow.\n\n\n\n          III\n\n          THE RECRUIT\n\n          Leave your home behind, lad,\n           And reach your friends your hand,\n          And go, and luck go with you\n           While Ludlow tower shall stand.\n\n          Oh, come you home of Sunday\n           When Ludlow streets are still\n          And Ludlow bells are calling\n           To farm and lane and mill,\n\n          Or come you home of Monday\n           When Ludlow market hums\n          And Ludlow chimes are playing\n           \"The conquering hero comes,\"\n\n          Come you home a hero,\n           Or come not home at all,\n          The lads you leave will mind you\n           Till Ludlow tower shall fall.\n\n          And you will list the bugle\n           That blows in lands of morn,\n          And make the foes of England\n           Be sorry you were born.\n\n          And you till trump of doomsday\n           On lands of morn may lie,\n          And make the hearts of comrades\n           Be heavy where you die.\n\n          Leave your home behind you,\n           Your friends by field and town\n          Oh, town and field will mind you\n           Till Ludlow tower is down.\n\n\n\n          IV\n\n          REVEILLE\n\n          Wake: the silver dusk returning\n           Up the beach of darkness brims,\n          And the ship of sunrise burning\n           Strands upon the eastern rims.\n\n          Wake: the vaulted shadow shatters,\n           Trampled to the floor it spanned,\n          And the tent of night in tatters\n           Straws the sky-pavilioned land.\n\n          Up, lad, up, 'tis late for lying:\n           Hear the drums of morning play;\n          Hark, the empty highways crying\n           \"Who'll beyond the hills away?\"\n\n          Towns and countries woo together,\n           Forelands beacon, belfries call;\n          Never lad that trod on leather\n           Lived to feast his heart with all.\n\n          Up, lad: thews that lie and cumber\n           Sunlit pallets never thrive;\n          Morns abed and daylight slumber\n           Were not meant for man alive.\n\n          Clay lies still, but blood's a rover;\n           Breath's a ware that will not keep\n          Up, lad: when the journey's over\n           There'll be time enough to sleep.\n\n\n\n          V\n\n          Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers\n           Are lying in field and lane,\n          With dandelions to tell the hours\n           That never are told again.\n          Oh may I squire you round the meads\n           And pick you posies gay?\n          -'Twill do no harm to take my arm.\n           \"You may, young man, you may.\"\n\n          Ah, spring was sent for lass and lad,\n           'Tis now the blood runs gold,\n          And man and maid had best be glad\n           Before the world is old.\n          What flowers to-day may flower to-morrow,\n           But never as good as new.\n          -Suppose I wound my arm right round-\n           \" 'Tis true, young man, 'tis true.\"\n\n          Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say,\n           That only court to thieve,\n          And once they bear the bloom away\n           'Tis little enough they leave.\n          Then keep your heart for men like me\n           And safe from trustless chaps.\n          My love is true and all for you.\n           \"Perhaps, young man, perhaps.\"\n\n          Oh, look in my eyes, then, can you doubt?\n           -Why, 'tis a mile from town.\n          How green the grass is all about!\n           We might as well sit down.\n          -Ah, life, what is it but a flower?\n           Why must true lovers sigh?\n          Be kind, have pity, my own, my pretty,-\n           \"Good-bye, young man, good-bye.\"\n\n\n\n          VI\n\n          When the lad for longing sighs,\n           Mute and dull of cheer and pale,\n          If at death's own door he lies,\n           Maiden, you can heal his ail.\n\n          Lovers' ills are all to buy:\n           The wan look, the hollow tone,\n          The hung head, the sunken eye,\n           You can have them for your own.\n\n          Buy them, buy them: eve and morn\n           Lovers' ills are all to sell.\n          Then you can lie down forlorn;\n           But the lover will be well.\n\n\n\n          VII\n\n          When smoke stood up from Ludlow,\n           And mist blew off from Teme,\n          And blithe afield to ploughing\n           Against the morning beam\n           I strode beside my team,\n\n          The blackbird in the coppice\n           Looked out to see me stride,\n          And hearkened as I whistled\n           The tramping team beside,\n           And fluted and replied:\n\n          \"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;\n           What use to rise and rise?\n          Rise man a thousand mornings\n           Yet down at last he lies,\n           And then the man is wise.\"\n\n          I heard the tune he sang me,\n           And spied his yellow bill;\n          I picked a stone and aimed it\n           And threw it with a will:\n           Then the bird was still.\n\n          Then my soul within me\n           Took up the blackbird's strain,\n          And still beside the horses\n           Along the dewy lane\n           It Sang the song again:\n\n          \"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;\n           The sun moves always west;\n          The road one treads to labour\n           Will lead one home to rest,\n           And that will be the best.\"\n\n\n\n          VIII\n\n          \"Farewell to barn and stack and tree,\n           Farewell to Severn shore.\n          Terence, look your last at me,\n           For I come home no more.\n\n          \"The sun burns on the half-mown hill,\n           By now the blood is dried;\n          And Maurice amongst the hay lies still\n           And my knife is in his side.\"\n\n          \"My mother thinks us long away;\n           'Tis time the field were mown.\n          She had two sons at rising day,\n           To-night she'll be alone.\"\n\n          \"And here's a bloody hand to shake,\n           And oh, man, here's good-bye;\n          We'll sweat no more on scythe and rake,\n           My bloody hands and I.\"\n\n          \"I wish you strength to bring you pride,\n           And a love to keep you clean,\n          And I wish you luck, come Lammastide,\n           At racing on the green.\"\n\n          \"Long for me the rick will wait,\n           And long will wait the fold,\n          And long will stand the empty plate,\n           And dinner will be cold.\"\n\n\n\n          IX\n\n          On moonlit heath and lonesome bank\n           The sheep beside me graze;\n          And yon the gallows used to clank\n           Fast by the four cross ways.\n\n          A careless shepherd once would keep\n           The flocks by moonlight there, (1)\n          And high amongst the glimmering sheep\n           The dead man stood on air.\n\n          They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:\n           The whistles blow forlorn,\n          And trains all night groan on the rail\n           To men that die at morn.\n\n          There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night,\n           Or wakes, as may betide,\n          A better lad, if things went right,\n           Than most that sleep outside.\n\n          And naked to the hangman's noose\n           The morning clocks will ring\n          A neck God made for other use\n           Than strangling in a string.\n\n          And sharp the link of life will snap,\n           And dead on air will stand\n          Heels that held up as straight a chap\n           As treads upon the land.\n\n          So here I'll watch the night and wait\n           To see the morning shine,\n          When he will hear the stroke of eight\n           And not the stroke of nine;\n\n          And wish my friend as sound a sleep\n           As lads' I did not know,\n          That shepherded the moonlit sheep\n           A hundred years ago.\n\n          (1) Hanging in chains was called keeping sheep by moonlight.\n\n\n\n          X\n\n          MARCH\n\n          The sun at noon to higher air,\n          Unharnessing the silver Pair\n          That late before his chariot swam,\n          Rides on the gold wool of the Ram.\n\n          So braver notes the storm-cock sings\n          To start the rusted wheel of things,\n          And brutes in field and brutes in pen\n          Leap that the world goes round again.\n\n          The boys are up the woods with day\n          To fetch the daffodils away,\n          And home at noonday from the hills\n          They bring no dearth of daffodils.\n\n          Afield for palms the girls repair,\n          And sure enough the palms are there,\n          And each will find by hedge or pond\n          Her waving silver-tufted wand.\n\n          In farm and field through all the shire\n          The eye beholds the heart's desire;\n          Ah, let not only mine be vain,\n          For lovers should be loved again.\n\n\n\n          XI\n\n          On your midnight pallet lying\n           Listen, and undo the door:\n          Lads that waste the light in sighing\n           In the dark should sigh no more;\n          Night should ease a lover's sorrow;\n          Therefore, since I go to-morrow;\n           Pity me before.\n\n          In the land to which I travel,\n           The far dwelling, let me say-\n          Once, if here the couch is gravel,\n           In a kinder bed I lay,\n          And the breast the darnel smothers\n          Rested once upon another's\n           When it was not clay.\n\n\n\n          XII\n\n          When I watch the living meet,\n           And the moving pageant file\n          Warm and breathing through the street\n           Where I lodge a little while,\n\n          If the heats of hate and lust\n           In the house of flesh are strong,\n          Let me mind the house of dust\n           Where my sojourn shall be long.\n\n          In the nation that is not\n           Nothing stands that stood before;\n          There revenges are forgot,\n           And the hater hates no more;\n\n          Lovers lying two and two\n           Ask not whom they sleep beside,\n          And the bridegroom all night through\n           Never turns him to the bride.\n\n\n\n          XIII\n\n          When I was one-and-twenty\n           I heard a wise man say,\n          \"Give crowns and pounds and guineas\n           But not your heart away;\n          Give pearls away and rubies\n           But keep your fancy free.\"\n          But I was one-and-twenty,\n           No use to talk to me.\n\n          When I was one-and-twenty\n           I heard him say again,\n          \"The heart out of the bosom\n           Was never given in vain;\n          'Tis paid with sighs a plenty\n           And sold for endless rue.\"\n          And I am two-and-twenty,\n           And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.\n\n\n\n          XIV\n\n          There pass the careless people\n           That call their souls their own:\n          Here by the road I loiter,\n           How idle and alone.\n\n          Ah, past the plunge of plummet,\n           In seas I cannot sound,\n          My heart and soul and senses,\n           World without end, are drowned.\n\n          His folly has not fellow\n           Beneath the blue of day\n          That gives to man or woman\n           His heart and soul away.\n\n          There flowers no balm to sain him\n           From east of earth to west\n          That's lost for everlasting\n           The heart out of his breast.\n\n          Here by the labouring highway\n           With empty hands I stroll:\n          Sea-deep, till doomsday morning,\n           Lie lost my heart and soul.\n\n\n\n          XV\n\n          Look not in my eyes, for fear\n           They mirror true the sight I see,\n          And there you find your face too clear\n           And love it and be lost like me.\n          One the long nights through must lie\n           Spent in star-defeated sighs,\n          But why should you as well as I\n           Perish? gaze not in my eyes.\n\n          A Grecian lad, as I hear tell,\n           One that many loved in vain,\n          Looked into a forest well\n           And never looked away again.\n          There, when the turf in springtime flowers,\n           With downward eye and gazes sad,\n          Stands amid the glancing showers\n           A jonquil, not a Grecian lad.\n\n\n\n          XVI\n\n          It nods and curtseys and recovers\n           When the wind blows above,\n          The nettle on the graves of lovers\n           That hanged themselves for love.\n\n          The nettle nods, the wind blows over,\n           The man, he does not move,\n          The lover of the grave, the lover\n           That hanged himself for love.\n\n\n\n          XVII\n\n          Twice a week the winter thorough\n           Here stood I to keep the goal:\n          Football then was fighting sorrow\n           For the young man's soul.\n\n          Now in May time to the wicket\n           Out I march with bat and pad:\n          See the son of grief at cricket\n           Trying to be glad.\n\n          Try I will; no harm in trying:\n           Wonder 'tis how little mirth\n          Keeps the bones of man from lying\n           On the bed of earth.\n\n\n\n          XVIII\n\n          Oh, when I was in love with you,\n           Then I was clean and brave,\n          And miles around the wonder grew\n           How well did I behave.\n\n          And now the fancy passes by,\n           And nothing will remain,\n          And miles around they'll say that I\n           Am quite myself again.\n\n\n\n          XIX\n\n          TO AN ATHLETE DYING YOUNG\n\n          The time you won your town the race\n          We chaired you through the market-place;\n          Man and boy stood cheering by,\n          And home we brought you shoulder-high.\n\n          To-day, the road all runners come,\n          Shoulder-high we bring you home,\n          And set you at your threshold down,\n          Townsman of a stiller town.\n\n          Smart lad, to slip betimes away\n          From fields where glory does not stay\n          And early though the laurel grows\n          It withers quicker than the rose.\n\n          Eyes the shady night has shut\n          Cannot see the record cut,\n          And silence sounds no worse than cheers\n          After earth has stopped the ears:\n\n          Now you will not swell the rout\n          Of lads that wore their honours out,\n          Runners whom renown outran\n          And the name died before the man.\n\n          So set, before its echoes fade,\n          The fleet foot on the sill of shade,\n          And hold to the low lintel up\n          The still-defended challenge-cup.\n\n          And round that early-laurelled head\n          Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,\n          And find unwithered on its curls\n          The garland briefer than a girl's.\n\n\n\n          XX\n\n          Oh fair enough are sky and plain,\n           But I know fairer far:\n          Those are as beautiful again\n           That in the water are;\n\n          The pools and rivers wash so clean\n           The trees and clouds and air,\n          The like on earth was never seen,\n           And oh that I were there.\n\n          These are the thoughts I often think\n           As I stand gazing down\n          In act upon the cressy brink\n           To strip and dive and drown;\n\n          But in the golden-sanded brooks\n           And azure meres I spy\n          A silly lad that longs and looks\n           And wishes he were I.\n\n\n\n          XXI\n\n          BREDON HILL (1)\n\n          In summertime on Bredon\n           The bells they sound so clear;\n          Round both the shires they ring them\n           In steeples far and near,\n           A happy noise to hear.\n\n          Here of a Sunday morning\n           My love and I would lie\n          And see the coloured counties,\n           And hear the larks so high\n           About us in the sky.\n\n          The bells would ring to call her\n           In valleys miles away:\n          \"Come all to church, good people;\n           Good people, come and pray.\"\n           But here my love would stay.\n\n          And I would turn and answer\n           Among the springing thyme,\n          \"Oh, peal upon our wedding,\n           And we will hear the chime,\n           And come to church in time.\"\n\n          But when the snows at Christmas\n           On Bredon top were strown,\n          My love rose up so early\n           And stole out unbeknown\n           And went to church alone.\n\n          They tolled the one bell only,\n           Groom there was none to see,\n          The mourners followed after,\n           And so to church went she,\n           And would not wait for me.\n\n          The bells they sound on Bredon,\n           And still the steeples hum.\n          \"Come all to church, good people,\"-\n           Oh, noisy bells, be dumb;\n           I hear you, I will come.\n\n\n          (1) Pronounced Breedon.\n\n\n\n          XXII\n\n          The street sounds to the soldiers' tread,\n           And out we troop to see:\n          A single redcoat turns his head,\n           He turns and looks at me.\n\n          My man, from sky to sky's so far,\n           We never crossed before;\n          Such leagues apart the world's ends are,\n           We're like to meet no more;\n\n          What thoughts at heart have you and I\n           We cannot stop to tell;\n          But dead or living, drunk or dry,\n           Soldier, I wish you well.\n\n\n\n          XXIII\n\n          The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair,\n           There's men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold,\n          The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there,\n           And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old.\n\n          There's chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart,\n           And many to count are the stalwart, and many the brave,\n          And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart,\n           And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave.\n\n          I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell\n           The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern;\n          And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell\n           And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.\n\n          But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan;\n           And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told\n          They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,\n           The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.\n\n\n\n          XXIV\n\n          Say, lad, have you things to do?\n           Quick then, while your day's at prime.\n          Quick, and if 'tis work for two,\n           Here am I, man: now's your time.\n\n          Send me now, and I shall go;\n           Call me, I shall hear you call;\n          Use me ere they lay me low\n           Where a man's no use at all;\n\n          Ere the wholesome flesh decay,\n           And the willing nerve be numb,\n          And the lips lack breath to say,\n           \"No, my lad, I cannot come.\"\n\n\n\n          XXV\n\n          This time of year a twelvemonth past,\n           When Fred and I would meet,\n          We needs must jangle, till at last\n           We fought and I was beat.\n\n          So then the summer fields about,\n           Till rainy days began,\n          Rose Harland on her Sundays out\n           Walked with the better man.\n\n          The better man she walks with still,\n           Though now 'tis not with Fred:\n          A lad that lives and has his will\n           Is worth a dozen dead.\n\n          Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather,\n           And clay's the house he keeps;\n          When Rose and I walk out together\n           Stock-still lies Fred and sleeps.\n\n\n\n          XXVI\n\n           Along the fields as we came by\n          A year ago, my love and I,\n          The aspen over stile and stone\n          Was talking to itself alone.\n          \"Oh who are these that kiss and pass?\n          A country lover and his lass;\n          Two lovers looking to be wed;\n          And time shall put them both to bed,\n          But she shall lie with earth above,\n          And he beside another love.\"\n\n           And sure enough beneath the tree\n          There walks another love with me,\n          And overhead the aspen heaves\n          Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;\n          And I spell nothing in their stir,\n          But now perhaps they speak to her,\n          And plain for her to understand\n          They talk about a time at hand\n          When I shall sleep with clover clad,\n          And she beside another lad.\n\n\n\n          XXVII\n\n          \"Is my team ploughing,\n           That I was used to drive\n          And hear the harness jingle\n           When I was man alive?\"\n\n          Ay, the horses trample,\n           The harness jingles now;\n          No change though you lie under\n           The land you used to plough.\n\n          \"Is football playing\n           Along the river shore,\n          With lads to chase the leather,\n           Now I stand up no more?\"\n\n          Ay, the ball is flying,\n           The lads play heart and soul;\n          The goal stands up, the keeper\n           Stands up to keep the goal.\n\n          \"Is my girl happy,\n           That I thought hard to leave,\n          And has she tired of weeping\n           As she lies down at eve?\"\n\n          Ay, she lies down lightly,\n           She lies not down to weep:\n          Your girl is well contented.\n           Be still, my lad, and sleep.\n\n          \"Is my friend hearty,\n           Now I am thin and pine,\n          And has he found to sleep in\n           A better bed than mine?\"\n\n          Yes, lad, I lie easy,\n           I lie as lads would choose;\n          I cheer a dead man's sweetheart,\n           Never ask me whose.\n\n\n\n          XXVIII\n\n          THE WELSH MARCHES\n\n          High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam\n          Islanded in Severn stream;\n          The bridges from the steepled crest\n          Cross the water east and west.\n\n          The flag of morn in conqueror's state\n          Enters at the English gate:\n          The vanquished eve, as night prevails,\n          Bleeds upon the road to Wales.\n\n          Ages since the vanquished bled\n          Round my mother's marriage-bed;\n          There the ravens feasted far\n          About the open house of war:\n\n          When Severn down to Buildwas ran\n          Coloured with the death of man,\n          Couched upon her brother's grave\n          The Saxon got me on the slave.\n\n          The sound of fight is silent long\n          That began the ancient wrong;\n          Long the voice of tears is still\n          That wept of old the endless ill.\n\n          In my heart it has not died,\n          The war that sleeps on Severn side;\n          They cease not fighting, east and west,\n          On the marches of my breast.\n\n          Here the truceless armies yet\n          Trample, rolled in blood and sweat;\n          They kill and kill and never die;\n          And I think that each is I.\n\n          None will part us, none undo\n          The knot that makes one flesh of two,\n          Sick with hatred, sick with pain,\n          Strangling-When shall we be slain?\n\n          When shall I be dead and rid\n          Of the wrong my father did?\n          How long, how long, till spade and hearse\n          Put to sleep my mother's curse?\n\n\n\n          XXIX\n\n          THE LENT LILY\n\n          'Tis spring; come out to ramble\n           The hilly brakes around,\n          For under thorn and bramble\n           About the hollow ground\n           The primroses are found.\n\n          And there's the windflower chilly\n           With all the winds at play,\n          And there's the Lenten lily\n           That has not long to stay\n           And dies on Easter day.\n\n          And since till

now, and sally\n           Upon the spring's array,\n          And bear from hill and valley\n           The daffodil away\n           That dies on Easter day.\n\n\n\n          XXX\n\n          Others, I am not the first,\n          Have willed more mischief than they durst:\n          If in the breathless night I too\n          Shiver now, 'tis nothing new.\n\n          More than I, if

When Uricon the city stood:\n          'Tis the old wind in the old anger,\n           But then it threshed another wood.\n\n          Then, 'twas before my time, the Roman\n           At yonder

This long and sure-set liking,\n           This boundless will to please,\n          -Oh, you should live for ever\n           If there were help in these.\n\n          But now, since all is idle,\n

sound,\n          Sate the king when healths went round.\n          They put arsenic in his meat\n          And stared aghast to watch him eat;\n          They poured strychnine in his cup\n

Along the way, the Earthmen stop at the city of the cart creatures and the site of the pyramid building creature for Leroy to take some samples. After picking up the film canisters from the crashed rocket at Thyle II, the two men fly east to Thyle I to look for signs of the birdlike Martian, Tweel.\nNear a canal, the men find a strange, deserted city thousands of years old. The buildings are inhabited by birdlike Martians of Tweel's species, including Tweel himself, and Jarvis and the Martian enjoy a happy reunion. Jarvis persuades Tweel to guide them through the city.\nIn one building, they come across a ratlike being hunched over a Martian book. Tweel angrily chases the rat-thing away and replaces the book on a shelf, though the Earthmen are not sure whether the rat-thing was reading the book or eating it. Elsewhere in the building, which seems to be a library, Tweel shows the Earthmen a huge mural of a human kneeling before a seated Martian. When Leroy remarks that the Martian in the mural looks like the Egyptian god Thoth, Tweel excitedly repeats the name, pointing to itself and all around them at the city. The Earthmen realize that Tweel's people, the Thoth, had visited ancient Egypt and served as inspiration for the Ibis-headed god. (This is actually anachronistic, since Thoth was the classical Greek version of the god's name.)\nOver the next three days, Tweel shows the Earthmen around the city, including a solar-powered pumping station designed to move water down the canal. Finally, a mile south of the ancient Martian city, the Earthmen find a valley filled with dream-beasts. As the dream-beasts mesmerize them, the two Earthmen see everything they have ever desired spread out before them, and rush forward helplessly. Tweel attacks one of the dream-beasts, momentarily freeing Jarvis. The Earthman kills the dream-beast with a pistol shot, then kills another that is attacking Leroy, and the three of them flee the valley. Jarvis and Leroy return to their rocket to recover from their encounter with the dream-beasts.\nBefore returning to the Ares, as a parting gift, the Earthmen take Tweel to the wreck of the other rocket, and give it the rocket's atomic power plant. In time, the Thoth will be able to master atomic power, and will no longer be dependent on solar power to run their civilization.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK VALLEY OF DREAMS ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Pat A.

How'd you like to spend a winter here?\"\n\nDick Jarvis, chemist of the party, shivered as he looked up from his\nnotebook. \"I'd just as soon spend it in a liquid air tank!\" he averred.\n\"These eighty-below zero summer nights are plenty for me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" mused the captain, \"the first successful Martian expedition\nought to be home long before then.\"\n\n\"Successful if we get home,\" corrected Jarvis. \"I don't trust these\ncranky rockets--not since the auxiliary dumped me in the middle of Thyle\nlast week. Walking back from a rocket ride is a new sensation to me.\"\n\n\"Which reminds me,\" returned Harrison, \"that we've got to recover your\nfilms. They're important if we're to pull this trip out of the red.\nRemember how the public mobbed the first moon pictures? Our shots ought\nto pack 'em to the doors. And the broadcast rights, too; we might show a\nprofit for the Academy.\"\n\n\"What interests me,\" countered Jarvis, \"is a personal profit. A book,\nfor instance; exploration books are always popular. _Martian\nDeserts_--how's that for a title?\"\n\n\"Lousy!\" grunted the captain. \"Sounds like a cook-book for desserts.\nYou'd have to call it 'Love Life of a Martian,' or something like that.\"\n\nJarvis chuckled. \"Anyway,\" he said, \"if we once get back home, I'm going\nto grab what profit there is, and never, never, get any farther from the\nearth than a good stratosphere plane'll take me. I've learned to\nappreciate the planet after plowing over this dried-up pill we're on\nnow.\"\n\n\"I'll lay you odds you'll be back here year after next,\" grinned the\nCaptain. \"You'll want to visit your pal--that trick ostrich.\"\n\n\"Tweel?\" The other's tone sobered. \"I wish I hadn't lost him, at that.\nHe was a good scout. I'd never have survived the dream-beast but for\nhim. And that battle with the push-cart things--I never even had a\nchance to thank him.\"\n\n\"A pair of lunatics, you two,\" observed Harrison. He squinted through\nthe port at the gray gloom of the Mare Cimmerium. \"There comes the sun.\"\nHe paused. \"Listen, Dick--you and Leroy take the other auxiliary rocket\nand go out and salvage those films.\"\n\nJarvis stared. \"Me and Leroy?\" he echoed ungrammatically. \"Why not me\nand Putz? An engineer would have some chance of getting us there and\nback if the rocket goes bad on us.\"\n\nThe captain nodded toward the stern, whence issued at that moment a\nmedley of blows and guttural expletives. \"Putz is going over the insides\nof the _Ares_,\" he announced. \"He'll have his hands full until we leave,\nbecause I want every bolt inspected. It's too late for repairs once we\ncast off.\"\n\n\"And if Leroy and I crack up? That's our last auxiliary.\"\n\n\"Pick up another ostrich and walk back,\" suggested Harrison gruffly.\nThen he smiled. \"If you have trouble, we'll hunt you out in the _Ares_,\"\nhe finished. \"Those films are important.\" He turned. \"Leroy!\"\n\nThe dapper little biologist appeared, his face questioning.\n\n\"You and Jarvis are off to salvage the auxiliary,\" the Captain said.\n\"Everything's ready and you'd better start now. Call back at half-hour\nintervals; I'll be listening.\"\n\nLeroy's eyes glistened. \"Perhaps we land for specimens--no?\" he queried.\n\n\"Land if you want to. This golf ball seems safe enough.\"\n\n\"Except for the dream-beast,\" muttered Jarvis with a faint shudder. He\nfrowned suddenly. \"Say, as long as we're going that way, suppose I have\na look for Tweel's home! He must live off there somewhere, and he's the\nmost important thing we've seen on Mars.\"\n\nHarrison hesitated. \"If I thought you could keep out of trouble,\" he\nmuttered. \"All right,\" he decided. \"Have a look. There's food and water\naboard the auxiliary; you can take a couple of days. But keep in touch\nwith me, you saps!\"\n\nJarvis and Leroy went through the airlock out to the grey plain. The\nthin air, still scarcely warmed by the rising sun, bit flesh and lung\nlike needles, and they gasped with a sense of suffocation. They dropped\nto a sitting posture, waiting for their bodies, trained by months in\nacclimatization chambers back on earth, to accommodate themselves to the\ntenuous air. Leroy's face, as always, turned a smothered blue, and\nJarvis heard his own breath rasping and rattling in his throat. But in\nfive minutes, the discomfort passed; they rose and entered the little\nauxiliary rocket that rested beside the black hull of the _Ares_.\n\nThe under-jets roared out their fiery atomic blast; dirt and bits of\nshattered biopods spun away in a cloud as the rocket rose. Harrison\nwatched the projectile trail its flaming way into the south, then turned\nback to his work.\n\nIt was four days before he saw the rocket again. Just at evening, as the\nsun dropped behind the horizon with the suddenness of a candle falling\ninto the sea, the auxiliary flashed out of the southern heavens, easing\ngently down on the flaming wings of the under-jets. Jarvis and Leroy\nemerged, passed through the swiftly gathering dusk, and faced him in the\nlight of the _Ares_. He surveyed the two; Jarvis was tattered and\nscratched, but apparently in better condition than Leroy, whose\ndapperness was completely lost. The little biologist was pale as the\nnearer moon that glowed outside; one arm was bandaged in thermo-skin and\nhis clothes hung in veritable rags. But it was his eyes that struck\nHarrison most strangely; to one who lived these many weary days with the\ndiminutive Frenchman, there was something queer about them. They were\nfrightened, plainly enough, and that was odd, since Leroy was no coward\nor he'd never have been one of the four chosen by the Academy for the\nfirst Martian expedition. But the fear in his eyes was more\nunderstandable than that other expression, that queer fixity of gaze\nlike one in a trance, or like a person in an ecstasy. \"Like a chap who's\nseen Heaven and Hell together,\" Harrison expressed it to himself. He was\nyet to discover how right he was.\n\nHe assumed a gruffness as the weary pair sat down. \"You're a fine\nlooking couple!\" he growled. \"I should've known better than to let you\nwander off alone.\" He paused. \"Is your arm all right, Leroy? Need any\ntreatment?\"\n\nJarvis answered. \"It's all right--just gashed. No danger of infection\nhere, I guess; Leroy says there aren't any microbes on Mars.\"\n\n\"Well,\" exploded the Captain, \"Let's hear it, then! Your radio reports\nsounded screwy. 'Escaped from Paradise!' Huh!\"\n\n\"I didn't want to give details on the radio,\" said Jarvis soberly.\n\"You'd have thought we'd gone loony.\"\n\n\"I think so, anyway.\"\n\n\"_Moi aussi!_\" muttered Leroy. \"I too!\"\n\n\"Shall I begin at the beginning?\" queried the chemist. \"Our early\nreports were pretty nearly complete.\" He stared at Putz, who had come in\nsilently, his face and hands blackened with carbon, and seated himself\nbeside Harrison.\n\n\"At the beginning,\" the Captain decided.\n\n\"Well,\" began Jarvis, \"we got started all right, and flew due south\nalong the meridian of the _Ares_, same course I'd followed last week. I\nwas getting used to this narrow horizon, so I didn't feel so much like\nbeing cooped under a big bowl, but one does keep overestimating\ndistances. Something four miles away looks eight when you're used to\nterrestrial curvature, and that makes you guess its size just four times\ntoo large. A little hill looks like a mountain until you're almost over\nit.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" grunted Harrison.\n\n\"Yes, but Leroy didn't, and I spent our first couple of hours trying to\nexplain it to him. By the time he understood (if he does yet) we were\npast Cimmerium and over that Xanthus desert, and then we crossed the\ncanal with the mud city and the barrel-shaped citizens and the place\nwhere Tweel had shot the dream-beast. And nothing would do for Pierre\nhere but that we put down so he could practice his biology on the\nremains. So we did.\n\n\"The thing was still there. No sign of decay; couldn't be, of course,\nwithout bacterial forms of life, and Leroy says that Mars is as sterile\nas an operating table.\"\n\n\"_Comme le coeur d'une fileuse_,\" corrected the little biologist, who\nwas beginning to regain a trace of his usual energy. \"Like an old maid's\nheart!\"\n\n\"However,\" resumed Jarvis, \"about a hundred of the little grey-green\nbiopods had fastened onto the thing and were growing and branching.\nLeroy found a stick and knocked 'em off, and each branch broke away and\nbecame a biopod crawling around with the others. So he poked around at\nthe creature, while I looked away from it; even dead, that rope-armed\ndevil gave me the creeps. And then came the surprise; the thing was part\nplant!\"\n\n\"_C'est vrai!_\" confirmed the biologist. \"It's true!\"\n\n\"It was a big cousin of the biopods,\" continued Jarvis. \"Leroy was quite\nexcited; he figures that all Martian life is of that sort--neither plant\nnor animal. Life here never differentiated, he says; everything has both\nnatures in it, even the barrel-creatures--even Tweel! I think he's\nright, especially when I recall how Tweel rested, sticking his beak in\nthe ground and staying that way all night. I never saw him eat or drink,\neither; perhaps his beak was more in the nature of a root, and he got\nhis nourishment that way.\"\n\n\"Sounds nutty to me,\" observed Harrison.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Jarvis, \"we broke up a few of the other growths and\nthey acted the same way--the pieces crawled around, only much slower\nthan the biopods, and then stuck themselves in the ground. Then Leroy\nhad to catch a sample of the walking grass, and we were ready to leave\nwhen a parade of the barrel-creatures rushed by with their push-carts.\nThey hadn't forgotten me, either; they all drummed out, 'We are\nv-r-r-iends--ouch!' just as they had before. Leroy wanted to shoot one\nand cut it up, but I remembered the battle Tweel and I had had with\nthem, and vetoed the idea. But he did hit on a possible explanation as\nto what they did with all the rubbish they gathered.\"\n\n\"Made mud-pies, I guess,\" grunted the captain.\n\n\"More or less,\" agreed Jarvis. \"They use it for food, Leroy thinks. If\nthey're part vegetable, you see, that's what they'd want--soil with\norganic remains in it to make it fertile. That's why they ground up sand\nand biopods and other growths all together. See?\"\n\n\"Dimly,\" countered Harrison. \"How about the suicides?\"\n\n\"Leroy had a hunch there, too. The suicides jump into the grinder when\nthe mixture has too much sand and gravel; they throw themselves in to\nadjust the proportions.\"\n\n\"Rats!\" said Harrison disgustedly. \"Why couldn't they bring in some\nextra branches from outside?\"\n\n\"Because suicide is easier. You've got to remember that these creatures\ncan't be judged by earthly standards; they probably don't feel pain, and\nthey haven't got what we'd call individuality. Any intelligence they\nhave is the property of the whole community--like an ant-heap. That's\nit! Ants are willing to die for their ant-hill; so are these creatures.\"\n\n\"So are men,\" observed the captain, \"if it comes to that.\"\n\n\"Yes, but men aren't exactly eager. It takes some emotion like\npatriotism to work 'em to the point of dying for their country; these\nthings do it all in the day's work.\" He paused.\n\n\"Well, we took some pictures of the dream-beast and the\nbarrel-creatures, and then we started along. We sailed over Xanthus,\nkeeping as close to the meridian of the _Ares_ as we could, and pretty\nsoon we crossed the trail of the pyramid-builder. So we circled back to\nlet Leroy take a look at it, and when we found it, we landed. The thing\nhad completed just two rows of bricks since Tweel and I left it, and\nthere it was, breathing in silicon and breathing out bricks as if it had\neternity to do it in--which it has. Leroy wanted to dissect it with a\nBoland explosive bullet, but I thought that anything that had lived for\nten million years was entitled to the respect due old age, so I talked\nhim out of it. He peeped into the hole on top of it and nearly got\nbeaned by the arm coming up with a brick, and then he chipped off a few\npieces of it, which didn't disturb the creature a bit. He found the\nplace I'd chipped, tried to see if there was any sign of healing, and\ndecided he could tell better in two or three thousand years. So we took\na few shots of it and sailed on.\n\n\"Mid afternoon we located the wreck of my rocket. Not a thing disturbed;\nwe picked up my films and tried to decide what next. I wanted to find\nTweel if possible; I figured from the fact of his pointing south that he\nlived somewhere near Thyle. We plotted our route and judged that the\ndesert we were in now was Thyle II; Thyle I should be east of us. So, on\na hunch, we decided to have a look at Thyle I, and away we buzzed.\"\n\n\"_Der_ motors?\" queried Putz, breaking his long silence.\n\n\"For a wonder, we had no trouble, Karl. Your blast worked perfectly. So\nwe hummed along, pretty high to get a wider view, I'd say about fifty\nthousand feet. Thyle II spread out like an orange carpet, and after a\nwhile we came to the grey branch of the Mare Chronium that bounded it.\nThat was narrow; we crossed it in half an hour, and there was Thyle\nI--same orange-hued desert as its mate. We veered south, toward the Mare\nAustrale, and followed the edge of the desert. And toward sunset we\nspotted it.\"\n\n\"Shpotted?\" echoed Putz. \"Vot vas shpotted?\"\n\n\"The desert was spotted--with buildings! Not one of the mud cities of\nthe canals, although a canal went through it. From the map we figured\nthe canal was a continuation of the one Schiaparelli called Ascanius.\n\n\"We were probably too high to be visible to any inhabitants of the city,\nbut also too high for a good look at it, even with the glasses. However,\nit was nearly sunset, anyway, so we didn't plan on dropping in. We\ncircled the place; the canal went out into the Mare Australe, and there,\nglittering in the south, was the melting polar ice-cap! The canal\ndrained it; we could distinguish the sparkle of water in it. Off to the\nsoutheast, just at the edge of the Mare Australe, was a valley--the\nfirst irregularity I'd seen on Mars except the cliffs that bounded\nXanthus and Thyle II. We flew over the valley--\" Jarvis paused suddenly\nand shuddered; Leroy, whose color had begun to return, seemed to pale.\nThe chemist resumed, \"Well, the valley looked all right--then! Just a\ngray waste, probably full of crawlers like the others.\n\n\"We circled back over the city; say, I want to tell you that place\nwas--well, gigantic! It was colossal; at first I thought the size was\ndue to that illusion I spoke of--you know, the nearness of the\nhorizon--but it wasn't that. We sailed right over it, and you've never\nseen anything like it!\n\n\"But the sun dropped out of sight right then. I knew we were pretty far\nsouth--latitude 60--but I didn't know just how much night we'd have.\"\n\nHarrison glanced at a Schiaparelli chart. \"About 60--eh?\" he said.\n\"Close to what corresponds to the Antarctic circle. You'd have about\nfour hours of night at this season. Three months from now you'd have\nnone at all.\"\n\n\"Three months!\" echoed Jarvis, surprised. Then he grinned. \"Right! I\nforget the seasons here are twice as long as ours. Well, we sailed out\ninto the desert about twenty miles, which put the city below the horizon\nin case we overslept, and there we spent the night.\n\n\"You're right about the length of it. We had about four hours of\ndarkness which left us fairly rested. We ate breakfast, called our\nlocation to you, and started over to have a look at the city.\n\n\"We sailed toward it from the east and it loomed up ahead of us like a\nrange of mountains. Lord, what a city! Not that New York mightn't have\nhigher buildings, or Chicago cover more ground, but for sheer mass,\nthose structures were in a class by themselves. Gargantuan!\n\n\"There was a queer look about the place, though. You know how a\nterrestrial city sprawls out, a nimbus of suburbs, a ring of residential\nsections, factory districts, parks, highways. There was none of that\nhere; the city rose out of the desert as abruptly as a cliff. Only a few\nlittle sand mounds marked the division, and then the walls of those\ngigantic structures.\n\n\"The architecture was strange, too. There were lots of devices that are\nimpossible back home, such as set-backs in reverse, so that a building\nwith a small base could spread out as it rose. That would be a valuable\ntrick in New York, where land is almost priceless, but to do it, you'd\nhave to transfer Martian gravitation there!\n\n\"Well, since you can't very well land a rocket in a city street, we put\ndown right next to the canal side of the city, took our small cameras\nand revolvers, and started for a gap in the wall of masonry. We weren't\nten feet from the rocket when we both saw the explanation for a lot of\nthe queerness.\n\n\"The city was in ruin! Abandoned, deserted, dead as Babylon! Or at\nleast, so it looked to us then, with its empty streets which, if they\nhad been paved, were now deep under sand.\"\n\n\"A ruin, eh?\" commented Harrison. \"How old?\"\n\n\"How could we tell?\" countered Jarvis. \"The next expedition to this golf\nball ought to carry an archeologist--and a philologist, too, as we\nfound out later. But it's a devil of a job to estimate the age of\nanything here; things weather so slowly that most of the buildings might\nhave been put up yesterday. No rainfall, no earthquakes, no vegetation\nis here to spread cracks with its roots--nothing. The only aging factors\nhere are the erosion of the wind--and that's negligible in this\natmosphere--and the cracks caused by changing temperature. And one other\nagent--meteorites. They must crash down occasionally on the city,\njudging from the thinness of the air, and the fact that we've seen four\nstrike ground right here near the _Ares_.\"\n\n\"Seven,\" corrected the captain. \"Three dropped while you were gone.\"\n\n\"Well, damage by meteorites must be slow, anyway. Big ones would be as\nrare here as on earth, because big ones get through in spite of the\natmosphere, and those buildings could sustain a lot of little ones. My\nguess at the city's age--and it may be wrong by a big percentage--would\nbe fifteen thousand years. Even that's thousands of years older than any\nhuman civilization; fifteen thousand years ago was the Late Stone Age in\nthe history of mankind.\n\n\"So Leroy and I crept up to those tremendous buildings feeling like\npygmies, sort of awe-struck, and talking in whispers. I tell you, it was\nghostly walking down that dead and deserted street, and every time we\npassed through a shadow, we shivered, and not just because shadows are\ncold on Mars. We felt like intruders, as if the great race that had\nbuilt the place might resent our presence even across a hundred and\nfifty centuries. The place was as quiet as a grave, but we kept\nimagining things and peeping down the dark lanes between buildings and\nlooking over our shoulders. Most of the structures were windowless, but\nwhen we did see an opening in those vast walls, we couldn't look away,\nexpecting to see some horror peering out of it.\n\n\"Then we passed an edifice with an open arch; the doors were there, but\nblocked open by sand. I got up nerve enough to take a look inside, and\nthen, of course, we discovered we'd forgotten to take our flashes. But\nwe eased a few feet into the darkness and the passage debouched into a\ncolossal hall. Far above us a little crack let in a pallid ray of\ndaylight, not nearly enough to light the place; I couldn't even see if\nthe hall rose clear to the distant roof. But I know the place was\nenormous; I said something to Leroy and a million thin echoes came\nslipping back to us out of the darkness. And after that, we began to\nhear other sounds--slithering rustling noises, and whispers, and sounds\nlike suppressed breathing--and something black and silent passed between\nus and that far-away crevice of light.\n\n\"Then we saw three little greenish spots of luminosity in the dusk to\nour left. We stood staring at them, and suddenly they all shifted at\nonce. Leroy yelled '_Ce sont des yeux!_' and they were! They were eyes!\n\n\"Well, we stood frozen for a moment, while Leroy's yell reverberated\nback and forth between the distant walls, and the echoes repeated the\nwords in queer, thin voices. There were mumblings and mutterings and\nwhisperings and sounds like strange soft laughter, and then the\nthree-eyed thing moved again. Then we broke for the door!\n\n\"We felt better out in the sunlight; we looked at each other sheepishly,\nbut neither of us suggested another look at the buildings inside--though\nwe _did_ see the place later, and that was queer, too--but you'll hear\nabout it when I come to it. We just loosened our revolvers and crept on\nalong that ghostly street.\n\n\"The street curved and twisted and subdivided. I kept careful note of\nour directions, since we couldn't risk getting lost in that gigantic\nmaze. Without our thermo-skin bags, night would finish us, even if what\nlurked in the ruins didn't. By and by, I noticed that we were veering\nback toward the canal, the buildings ended and there were only a few\ndozen ragged stone huts which looked as though they might have been\nbuilt of debris from the city. I was just beginning to feel a bit\ndisappointed at finding no trace of Tweel's people here when we rounded\na corner and there he was!\n\n\"I yelled 'Tweel!' but he just stared, and then I realized that he\nwasn't Tweel, but another Martian of his sort. Tweel's feathery\nappendages were more orange hued and he stood several inches taller than\nthis one. Leroy was sputtering in excitement, and the Martian kept his\nvicious beak directed at us, so I stepped forward as peace-maker. I said\n'Tweel?' very questioningly, but there was no result. I tried it a dozen\ntimes, and we finally had to give it up; we couldn't connect.\n\n\"Leroy and I walked toward the huts, and the Martian followed us. Twice\nhe was joined by others, and each time I tried yelling 'Tweel' at them\nbut they just stared at us. So we ambled on with the three trailing us,\nand then it suddenly occurred to me that my Martian accent might be at\nfault. I faced the group and tried trilling it out the way Tweel himself\ndid: 'T-r-r-rwee-r-rl!' Like that.\n\n\"And that worked! One of them spun his head around a full ninety\ndegrees, and screeched 'T-r-r-rweee-r-rl!' and a moment later, like an\narrow from a bow, Tweel came sailing over the nearer huts to land on his\nbeak in front of me!\n\n\"Man, we were glad to see each other! Tweel set up a twittering and\nchirping like a farm in summer and went sailing up and coming down on\nhis beak, and I would have grabbed his hands, only he wouldn't keep\nstill long enough.\n\n\"The other Martians and Leroy just stared, and after a while, Tweel\nstopped bouncing, and there we were. We couldn't talk to each other any\nmore than we could before, so after I'd said 'Tweel' a couple of times\nand he'd said 'Tick,' we were more or less helpless. However, it was\nonly mid-morning, and it seemed important to learn all we could about\nTweel and the city, so I suggested that he guide us around the place if\nhe weren't busy. I put over the idea by pointing back at the buildings\nand then at him and us.\n\n\"Well, apparently he wasn't too busy, for he set off with us, leading\nthe way with one of his hundred and fifty-foot nosedives that set Leroy\ngasping. When we caught up, he said something like 'one, one, two--two,\ntwo, four--no, no--yes, yes--rock--no breet!' That didn't seem to mean\nanything; perhaps he was just letting Leroy know that he could speak\nEnglish, or perhaps he was merely running over his vocabulary to refresh\nhis memory.\n\n\"Anyway, he showed us around. He had a light of sorts in his black\npouch, good enough for small rooms, but simply lost in some of the\ncolossal caverns we went through. Nine out of ten buildings meant\nabsolutely nothing to us--just vast empty chambers, full of shadows and\nrustlings and echoes. I couldn't imagine their use; they didn't seem\nsuitable for living quarters, or even for commercial purposes--trade and\nso forth; they might have been all right as power-houses, but what could\nhave been the purpose of a whole city full? And where were the remains\nof the machinery?\n\n\"The place was a mystery. Sometimes Tweel would show us through a hall\nthat would have housed an ocean-liner, and he'd seem to swell with\npride--and we couldn't make a damn thing of it! As a display of\narchitectural power, the city was colossal; as anything else it was just\nnutty!\n\n\"But we did see one thing that registered. We came to that same building\nLeroy and I had entered earlier--the one with the three eyes in it.\nWell, we were a little shaky about going in there, but Tweel twittered\nand trilled and kept saying, 'Yes, yes, yes!' so we followed him,\nstaring nervously about for the thing that had watched us. However, that\nhall was just like the others, full of murmurs and slithering noises and\nshadowy things slipping away into corners. If the three-eyed creature\nwere still there, it must have slunk away with the others.\n\n\"Tweel led us along the wall; his light showed a series of little\nalcoves, and in the first of these we ran into a puzzling thing--a very\nweird thing. As the light flashed into the alcove, I saw first just an\nempty space, and then, squatting on the floor, I saw--it! A little\ncreature about as big as a large rat, it was, gray and huddled and\nevidently startled by our appearance. It had the queerest, most devilish\nlittle face!--pointed ears or horns and satanic eyes that seemed to\nsparkle with a sort of fiendish intelligence.\n\n\"Tweel saw it, too, and let out a screech of anger, and the creature\nrose on two pencil-thin legs and scuttled off with a half-terrified,\nhalf defiant squeak. It darted past us into the darkness too quickly\neven for Tweel, and as it ran, something waved on its body like the\nfluttering of a cape. Tweel screeched angrily at it and set up a shrill\nhullabaloo that sounded like genuine rage.\n\n\"But the thing was gone, and then I noticed the weirdest of imaginable\ndetails. Where it had squatted on the floor was--a book! It had been\nhunched over a book!\n\n\"I took a step forward; sure enough, there was some sort of inscription\non the pages--wavy white lines like a seismograph record on black sheets\nlike the material of Tweel's pouch. Tweel fumed and whistled in wrath,\npicked up the volume and slammed it into place on a shelf full of\nothers. Leroy and I stared dumbfounded at each other.\n\n\"Had the little thing with the fiendish face been reading? Or was it\nsimply eating the pages, getting physical nourishment rather than\nmental? Or had the whole thing been accidental?\n\n\"If the creature were some rat-like pest that destroyed books, Tweel's\nrage was understandable, but why should he try to prevent an intelligent\nbeing, even though of an alien race, from _reading_--if it _was_ reading? I\ndon't know; I did notice that the book was entirely undamaged, nor did I\nsee a damaged book among any that we handled. But I have an odd hunch\nthat if we knew the secret of the little cape-clothed imp, we'd know the\nmystery of the vast abandoned city and of the decay of Martian culture.\n\n\"Well, Tweel quieted down after a while and led us completely around\nthat tremendous hall. It had been a library, I think; at least, there\nwere thousands upon thousands of those queer black-paged volumes printed\nin wavy lines of white. There were pictures, too, in some; and some of\nthese showed Tweel's people. That's a point, of course; it indicated\nthat his race built the city and printed the books. I don't think the\ngreatest philologist on earth will ever translate one line of those\nrecords; they were made by minds too different from ours.\n\n\"Tweel could read them, naturally. He twittered off a few lines, and\nthen I took a few of the books, with his permission; he said 'no, no!'\nto some and 'yes, yes!' to others. Perhaps he kept back the ones his\npeople needed, or perhaps he let me take the ones he thought we'd\nunderstand most easily. I don't know; the books are outside there in the\nrocket.\n\n\"Then he held that dim torch of his toward the walls, and they were\npictured. Lord, what pictures! They stretched up and up into the\nblackness of the roof, mysterious and gigantic. I couldn't make much of\nthe first wall; it seemed to be a portrayal of a great assembly of\nTweel's people. Perhaps it was meant to symbolize Society or Government.\nBut the next wall was more obvious; it showed creatures at work on a\ncolossal machine of some sort, and that would be Industry or Science.\nThe back wall had corroded away in part, from what we could see, I\nsuspected the scene was meant to portray Art, but it was on the fourth\nwall that we got a shock that nearly dazed us.\n\n\"I think the symbol was Exploration or Discovery. This wall was a little\nplainer, because the moving beam of daylight from that crack lit up the\nhigher surface and Tweel's torch illuminated the lower. We made out a\ngiant seated figure, one of the beaked Martians like Tweel, but with\nevery limb suggesting heaviness, weariness. The arms dropped inertly on\nthe chair, the thin neck bent and the beak rested on the body, as if the\ncreature could scarcely bear its own weight. And before it was a queer\nkneeling figure, and at sight of it, Leroy and I almost reeled against\neach other. It was, apparently, a man!\"\n\n\"A man!\" bellowed Harrison. \"A man you say?\"\n\n\"I said apparently,\" retorted Jarvis. \"The artist had exaggerated the\nnose almost to the length of Tweel's beak, but the figure had black\nshoulder-length hair, and instead of the Martian four, there were _five_\nfingers on its outstretched hand! It was kneeling as if in worship of\nthe Martian, and on the ground was what looked like a pottery bowl full\nof some food as an offering. Well! Leroy and I thought we'd gone\nscrewy!\"\n\n\"And Putz and I think so, too!\" roared the captain.\n\n\"Maybe we all have,\" replied Jarvis, with a faint grin at the pale face\nof the little Frenchman, who returned it in silence. \"Anyway,\" he\ncontinued, \"Tweel was squeaking and pointing at the figure, and saying\n'Tick! Tick!' so he recognized the resemblance--and never mind any\ncracks about my nose!\" he warned the captain. \"It was Leroy who made the\nimportant comment; he looked at the Martian and said 'Thoth! The god\nThoth!'\"\n\n\"_Oui!_\" confirmed the biologist. \"_Comme l'Egypte!_\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Jarvis. \"Like the Egyptian ibis-headed god--the one with\nthe beak. Well, no sooner did Tweel hear the name Thoth than he set up a\nclamor of twittering and squeaking. He pointed at himself and said\n'Thoth! Thoth!' and then waved his arm all around and repeated it. Of\ncourse he often did queer things, but we both thought we understood what\nhe meant. He was trying to tell us that his race called themselves\nThoth. Do you see what I'm getting at?\"\n\n\"I see, all right,\" said Harrison. \"You think the Martians paid a visit\nto the earth, and the Egyptians remembered it in their mythology. Well,\nyou're off, then; there wasn't any Egyptian civilization fifteen\nthousand years ago.\"\n\n\"Wrong!\" grinned Jarvis. \"It's too bad we _haven't_ an archeologist\nwith us, but Leroy tells me that there was a stone-age culture in Egypt\nthen, the pre-dynastic civilization.\"\n\n\"Well, even so, what of it?\"\n\n\"Plenty! Everything in that picture proves my point. The attitude of the\nMartian, heavy and weary--that's the unnatural strain of terrestrial\ngravitation. The name Thoth; Leroy tells me Thoth was the Egyptian god\nof philosophy and the inventor of _writing_! Get that? They must have\npicked up the idea from watching the Martian take notes. It's too much\nfor coincidence that Thoth should be beaked and ibis-headed, and that\nthe beaked Martians call themselves Thoth.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be hanged! But what about the nose on the Egyptian? Do you\nmean to tell me that stone-age Egyptians had longer noses than ordinary\nmen?\"\n\n\"Of course not! It's just that the Martians very naturally cast their\npaintings in Martianized form. Don't human beings tend to relate\neverything to themselves? That's why dugongs and manatees started the\nmermaid myths--sailors thought they saw human features on the beasts. So\nthe Martian artist, drawing either from descriptions or imperfect\nphotographs, naturally exaggerated the size of the human nose to a\ndegree that looked normal to him. Or anyway, that's my theory.\"\n\n\"Well, it'll do as a theory,\" grunted Harrison. \"What I want to hear is\nwhy you two got back here looking like a couple of year-before-last\nbird's nests.\"\n\nJarvis shuddered again, and cast another glance at Leroy. The little\nbiologist was recovering some of his accustomed poise, but he returned\nthe glance with an echo of the chemist's shudder.\n\n\"We'll get to that,\" resumed the latter. \"Meanwhile I'll stick to Tweel\nand his people. We spent the better part of three days with them, as you\nknow. I can't give every detail, but I'll summarize the important facts\nand give our conclusions, which may not be worth an inflated franc. It's\nhard to judge this dried-up world by earthly standards.\n\n\"We took pictures of everything possible; I even tried to photograph\nthat gigantic mural in the library, but unless Tweel's lamp was\nunusually rich in actinic rays, I don't suppose it'll show. And that's a\npity, since it's undoubtedly the most interesting object we've found on\nMars, at least from a human viewpoint.\n\n\"Tweel was a very courteous host. He took us to all the points of\ninterest--even the new water-works.\"\n\nPutz's eyes brightened at the word. \"Vater-vorks?\" he echoed. \"For vot?\"\n\n\"For the canal, naturally. They have to build up a head of water to\ndrive it through; that's obvious.\" He looked at the captain. \"You told\nme yourself that to drive water from the polar caps of Mars to the\nequator was equivalent to forcing it up a twenty-mile hill, because Mars\nis flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator just like the\nearth.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" agreed Harrison.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Jarvis, \"this city was one of the relay stations to\nboost the flow. Their power plant was the only one of the giant\nbuildings that seemed to serve any useful purpose, and that was worth\nseeing. I wish you'd seen it, Karl; you'll have to make what you can\nfrom our pictures. It's a sun-power plant!\"\n\nHarrison and Putz stared. \"Sun-power!\" grunted the captain. \"That's\nprimitive!\" And the engineer added an emphatic \"_Ja!_\" of agreement.\n\n\"Not as primitive as all that,\" corrected Jarvis. \"The sunlight focused\non a queer cylinder in the center of a big concave mirror, and they drew\nan electric current from it. The juice worked the pumps.\"\n\n\"A t'ermocouple!\" ejaculated Putz.\n\n\"That sounds reasonable; you can judge by the pictures. But the\npower-plant had some queer things about it. The queerest was that the\nmachinery was tended, not by Tweel's people, but by some of the\nbarrel-shaped creatures like the ones in Xanthus!\" He gazed around at\nthe faces of his auditors; there was no comment.\n\n\"Get it?\" he resumed. At their silence, he proceeded, \"I see you don't.\nLeroy figured it out, but whether rightly or wrongly, I don't know. He\nthinks that the barrels and Tweel's race have a reciprocal arrangement\nlike--well, like bees and flowers on earth. The flowers give honey for\nthe bees; the bees carry the pollen for the flowers. See? The barrels\ntend the works and Tweel's people build the canal system. The Xanthus\ncity must have been a boosting station; that explains the mysterious\nmachines I saw. And Leroy believes further that it isn't an intelligent\narrangement--not on the part of the barrels, at least--but that it's been\ndone for so many thousands of generations that it's become\ninstinctive--a tropism--just like the actions of ants and bees. The\ncreatures have been bred to it!\"\n\n\"Nuts!\" observed Harrison. \"Let's hear you explain the reason for that\nbig empty city, then.\"\n\n\"Sure. Tweel's civilization is decadent, that's the reason. It's a dying\nrace, and out of all the millions that must once have lived there,\nTweel's couple of hundred companions are the remnant. They're an\noutpost, left to tend the source of the water at the polar cap; probably\nthere are still a few respectable cities left somewhere on the canal\nsystem, most likely near the tropics. It's the last gasp of a race--and\na race that reached a higher peak of culture than Man!\"\n\n\"Huh?\" said Harrison. \"Then why are they dying? Lack of water?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" responded the chemist. \"If my guess at the city's\nage is right, fifteen thousand years wouldn't make enough difference in\nthe water supply--nor a hundred thousand, for that matter. It's\nsomething else, though the water's doubtless a factor.\"\n\n\"_Das wasser_,\" cut in Putz. \"Vere goes dot?\"\n\n\"Even a chemist knows that!\" scoffed Jarvis. \"At least on earth. Here\nI'm not so sure, but on earth, every time there's a lightning flash, it\nelectrolyzes some water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen, and then the\nhydrogen escapes into space, because terrestrial gravitation won't hold\nit permanently. And every time there's an earthquake, some water is lost\nto the interior. Slow--but damned certain.\" He turned to Harrison.\n\"Right, Cap?\"\n\n\"Right,\" conceded the captain. \"But here, of course--no earthquakes, no\nthunderstorms--the loss must be very slow. Then why is the race dying?\"\n\n\"The sun-power plant answers that,\" countered Jarvis. \"Lack of fuel!\nLack of power! No oil left, no coal left--if Mars ever had a\nCarboniferous Age--and no water-power--just the driblets of energy they\ncan get from the sun. That's why they're dying.\"\n\n\"With the limitless energy of the atom?\" exploded Harrison.\n\n\"They don't know about atomic energy. Probably never did. Must have used\nsome other principle in their space-ship.\"\n\n\"Then,\" snapped the captain, \"what makes you rate their intelligence\nabove the human? We've finally cracked open the atom!\"\n\n\"Sure we have. We had a clue, didn't we? Radium and uranium. Do you\nthink we'd ever have learned how without those elements? We'd never even\nhave suspected that atomic energy existed!\"\n\n\"Well? Haven't they--?\"\n\n\"No, they haven't. You've told me yourself that Mars has only 73 percent\nof the earth's density. Even a chemist can see that that means a lack of\nheavy metals--no osmium, no uranium, no radium. They didn't have the\nclue.\"\n\n\"Even so, that doesn't prove they're more advanced than we are. If they\nwere _more_ advanced, they'd have discovered it anyway.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" conceded Jarvis. \"I'm not claiming that we don't surpass them\nin some ways. But in others, they're far ahead of us.\"\n\n\"In what, for instance?\"\n\n\"Well--socially, for one thing.\"\n\n\"Huh? How do you mean?\"\n\nJarvis glanced in turn at each of the three that faced him. He\nhesitated. \"I wonder how you chaps will take this,\" he muttered.\n\"Naturally, everybody likes his own system best.\" He frowned. \"Look\nhere--on the earth we have three types of society, haven't we? And\nthere's a member of each type right here. Putz lives under a\ndictatorship--an autocracy. Leroy's a citizen of the Sixth Commune in\nFrance. Harrison and I are Americans, members of a democracy. There you\nare--autocracy, democracy, communism--the three types of terrestrial\nsocieties. Tweel's people have a different system from any of us.\"\n\n\"Different? What is it?\"\n\n\"The one no earthly nation has tried. Anarchy!\"\n\n\"Anarchy!\" the captain and Putz burst out together.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"But--\" Harrison was sputtering. \"What do you mean--they're ahead of us?\nAnarchy! Bah!\"\n\n\"All right--bah!\" retorted Jarvis. \"I'm not saying it would work for us,\nor for any race of men. But it works for them.\"\n\n\"But--anarchy!\" The captain was indignant.\n\n\"Well, when you come right down to it,\" argued Jarvis defensively,\n\"anarchy is the ideal form of government, if it works. Emerson said that\nthe best government was that which governs least, and so did Wendell\nPhillips, and I think George Washington. And you can't have any form of\ngovernment which governs less than anarchy, which is no government at\nall!\"\n\nThe captain was sputtering. \"But--it's unnatural! Even savage tribes\nhave their chiefs! Even a pack of wolves has its leader!\"\n\n\"Well,\" retorted Jarvis defiantly, \"that only proves that government is\na primitive device, doesn't it? With a perfect race you wouldn't need it\nat all; government is a confession of weakness, isn't it? It's a\nconfession that part of the people won't cooperate with the rest and\nthat you need laws to restrain those individuals which a psychologist\ncalls anti-social. If there were no anti-social persons--criminals and\nsuch--you wouldn't need laws or police, would you?\"\n\n\"But government! You'd need government! How about public\nworks--wars--taxes?\"\n\n\"No wars on Mars, in spite of being named after the War God. No point in\nwars here; the population is too thin and too scattered, and besides, it\ntakes the help of every single community to keep the canal system\nfunctioning. No taxes because, apparently, all individuals cooperate in\nbuilding public works. No competition to cause trouble, because anybody\ncan help himself to anything. As I said, with a perfect race government\nis entirely unnecessary.\"\n\n\"And do you consider the Martians a perfect race?\" asked the captain\ngrimly.\n\n\"Not at all! But they've existed so much longer than man that they're\nevolved, socially at least, to the point where they don't need\ngovernment. They work together, that's all.\" Jarvis paused. \"Queer,\nisn't it--as if Mother Nature were carrying on two experiments, one at\nhome and one on Mars. On earth it's trial of an emotional, highly\ncompetitive race in a world of plenty; here it's the trial of a quiet,\nfriendly race on a desert, unproductive, and inhospitable world.\nEverything here makes for cooperation. Why, there isn't even the factor\nthat causes so much trouble at home--sex!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah: Tweel's people reproduce just like the barrels in the mud cities;\ntwo individuals grow a third one between them. Another proof of Leroy's\ntheory that Martian life is neither animal nor vegetable. Besides, Tweel\nwas a good enough host to let him poke down his beak and twiddle his\nfeathers, and the examination convinced Leroy.\"\n\n\"_Oui_,\" confirmed the biologist. \"It is true.\"\n\n\"But anarchy!\" grumbled Harrison disgustedly. \"It would show up on a\ndizzy, half-dead pill like Mars!\"\n\n\"It'll be a good many centuries before you'll have to worry about it on\nearth,\" grinned Jarvis. He resumed his narrative.\n\n\"Well, we wandered through that sepulchral city, taking pictures of\neverything. And then--\" Jarvis paused and shuddered--\"then I took a\nnotion to have a look at that valley we'd spotted from the rocket. I\ndon't know why. But when we tried to steer Tweel in that direction, he\nset up such a squawking and screeching that I thought he'd gone batty.\"\n\n\"If possible!\" jeered Harrison.\n\n\"So we started over there without him; he kept wailing and screaming,\n'No-no-no! Tick!' but that made us the more curious. He sailed over our\nheads and stuck on his beak, and went through a dozen other antics, but\nwe ploughed on, and finally he gave up and trudged disconsolately along\nwith us.\n\n\"The valley wasn't more than a mile southeast of the city. Tweel could\nhave covered the distance in twenty jumps, but he lagged and loitered\nand kept pointing back at the city and wailing 'No--no--no!' Then he'd\nsail up into the air and zip down on his beak directly in front of us,\nand we'd have to walk around him. I'd seen him do lots of crazy things\nbefore, of course; I was used to them, but it was as plain as print that\nhe didn't want us to see that valley.\"\n\n\"Why?\" queried Harrison.\n\n\"You asked why we came back like tramps,\" said Jarvis with a faint\nshudder. \"You'll learn. We plugged along up a low rocky hill that\nbounded it, and as we neared the top, Tweel said, 'No breet', Tick! No\nbreet'!' Well, those were the words he used to describe the silicon\nmonster; they were also the words he had used to tell me that the image\nof Fancy Long, the one that had almost lured me to the dream-beast,\nwasn't real. I remembered that, but it meant nothing to me--then!\n\n\"Right after that, Tweel said, 'You one-one-two, he one-one-two,' and\nthen I began to see. That was the phrase he had used to explain the\ndream-beast to tell me that what I thought, the creature thought--to\ntell me how the thing lured its victims by their own desires. So I\nwarned Leroy; it seemed to me that even the dream-beast couldn't be\ndangerous if we were warned and expecting it. Well, I was wrong!\n\n\"As we reached the crest, Tweel spun his head completely around, so his\nfeet were forward but his eyes looked backward, as if he feared to gaze\ninto the valley. Leroy and I stared out over it, just a gray waste like\nthis around us, with the gleam of the south polar cap far beyond its\nsouthern rim. That's what it was one second; the next it was--Paradise!\"\n\n\"What?\" exclaimed the captain.\n\nJarvis turned to Leroy. \"Can you describe it?\" he asked.\n\nThe biologist waved helpless hands, \"_C'est impossible!_\" he whispered.\n\"_Il me rend muet!_\"\n\n\"It strikes me dumb, too,\" muttered Jarvis. \"I don't know how to tell\nit; I'm a chemist, not a poet. Paradise is as good a word as I can think\nof, and that's not at all right. It was Paradise and Hell in one!\"\n\n\"Will you talk sense?\" growled Harrison.\n\n\"As much of it as makes sense. I tell you, one moment we were looking at\na grey valley covered with blobby plants, and the next--Lord! You can't\nimagine that next moment! How would you like to see all your dreams made\nreal? Every desire you'd ever had gratified? Everything you'd ever\nwanted there for the taking?\"\n\n\"I'd like it fine!\" said the captain.\n\n\"You're welcome, then!--not only your noble desires, remember! Every\ngood impulse, yes--but also every nasty little wish, every vicious\nthought, everything you'd ever desired, good or bad! The dream-beasts\nare marvelous salesmen, but they lack the moral sense!\"\n\n\"The dream-beasts?\"\n\n\"Yes. It was a valley of them. Hundreds, I suppose, maybe thousands.\nEnough, at any rate, to spread out a complete picture of your desires,\neven all the forgotten ones that must have been drawn out of the\nsubconscious. A Paradise--of sorts! I saw a dozen Fancy Longs, in every\ncostume I'd ever admired on her, and some I must have imagined. I saw\nevery beautiful woman I've ever known, and all of them pleading for my\nattention. I saw every lovely place I'd ever wanted to be, all packed\nqueerly into that little valley. And I saw--other things.\" He shook his\nhead soberly. \"It wasn't all exactly pretty. Lord! How much of the beast\nis left in us! I suppose if every man alive could have one look at that\nweird valley, and could see just once what nastiness is hidden in\nhim--well, the world might gain by it. I thanked heaven afterwards that\nLeroy--and even Tweel--saw their own pictures and not mine!\"\n\nJarvis paused again, then resumed, \"I turned dizzy with a sort of\necstasy. I closed my eyes--and with eyes closed, I still saw the whole\nthing! That beautiful, evil, devilish panorama was in my mind, not my\neyes. That's how those fiends work--through the mind. I knew it was the\ndream-beasts; I didn't need Tweel's wail of 'No breet'! No breet'!'\nBut--_I couldn't keep away!_ I knew it was death beckoning, but it was\nworth it for one moment with the vision.\"\n\n\"Which particular vision?\" asked Harrison dryly.\n\nJarvis flushed. \"No matter,\" he said. \"But beside me I heard Leroy's cry\nof 'Yvonne! Yvonne!' and I knew he was trapped like myself. I fought for\nsanity; I kept telling myself to stop, and all the time I was rushing\nheadlong into the snare!\n\n\"Then something tripped me. Tweel! He had come leaping from behind; as I\ncrashed down I saw him flash over me straight toward--toward what I'd\nbeen running to, with his vicious beak pointed right at her heart!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" nodded the captain. \"_Her_ heart!\"\n\n\"Never mind that. When I scrambled up, that particular image was gone,\nand Tweel was in a twist of black ropey arms, just as when I first saw\nhim. He'd missed a vital point in the beast's anatomy, but was jabbing\naway desperately with his beak.\n\n\"Somehow, the spell had lifted, or partially lifted. I wasn't five feet\nfrom Tweel, and it took a terrific struggle, but I managed to raise my\nrevolver and put a Boland shell into the beast. Out came a spurt of\nhorrible black corruption, drenching Tweel and me--and I guess the\nsickening smell of it helped to destroy the illusion of that valley of\nbeauty. Anyway, we managed to get Leroy away from the devil that had\nhim, and the three of us staggered to the ridge and over. I had presence\nof mind enough to raise my camera over the crest and take a shot of the\nvalley, but I'll bet it shows nothing but gray waste and writhing\nhorrors. What we saw was with our minds, not our eyes.\"\n\nJarvis paused and shuddered. \"The brute half poisoned Leroy,\" he\ncontinued. \"We dragged ourselves back to the auxiliary, called you, and\ndid what we could to treat ourselves. Leroy took a long dose of the\ncognac that we had with us; we didn't dare try anything of Tweel's\nbecause his metabolism is so different from ours that what cured him\nmight kill us. But the cognac seemed to work, and so, after I'd done one\nother thing I wanted to do, we came back here--and that's all.\"\n\n\"All, is it?\" queried Harrison. \"So you've solved all the mysteries of\nMars, eh?\"\n\n\"Not by a damned sight!\" retorted Jarvis. \"Plenty of unanswered\nquestions are left.\"\n\n\"_Ja!_\" snapped Putz. \"Der evaporation--dot iss shtopped how?\"\n\n\"In the canals? I wondered about that, too; in those thousands of miles,\nand against this low air-pressure, you'd think they'd lose a lot. But\nthe answer's simple; they float a skin of oil on the water.\"\n\nPutz nodded, but Harrison cut in. \"Here's a puzzler. With only coal and\noil--just combustion or electric power--where'd they get the energy to\nbuild a planet-wide canal system, thousands and thousands of miles of\n'em? Think of the job we had cutting the Panama Canal to sea level, and\nthen answer that!\"\n\n\"Easy!\" grinned Jarvis. \"Martian gravity and Martian air--that's the\nanswer. Figure it out: First, the dirt they dug only weighed a third its\nearth-weight. Second, a steam engine here expands against ten pounds per\nsquare inch less air pressure than on earth. Third, they could build the\nengine three times as large here with no greater internal weight. And\nfourth, the whole planet's nearly level. Right, Putz?\"\n\nThe engineer nodded. \"_Ja!_ Der shteam--engine--it iss _sieben-und\nzwanzig_--twenty-seven times so effective here.\"\n\n\"Well, there _does_ go the last mystery then,\" mused Harrison.\n\n\"Yeah?\" queried Jarvis sardonically. \"You answer these, then. What was\nthe nature of that vast empty city? Why do the Martians _need_ canals,\nsince we never saw them eat or drink? Did they really visit the earth\nbefore the dawn of history, and, if not atomic energy, what powered\ntheir ship? Since Tweel's race seems to need little or no water, are\nthey merely operating the canals for some higher creature that does?\n_Are_ there other intelligences on Mars? If not, what was the\ndemon-faced imp we saw with the book? There are a few mysteries for\nyou!\"\n\n\"I know one or two more!\" growled Harrison, glaring suddenly at little\nLeroy. \"You and your visions! 'Yvonne!' eh? Your wife's name is Marie,\nisn't it?\"\n\nThe little biologist turned crimson. \"_Oui_,\" he admitted unhappily. He\nturned pleading eyes on the captain. \"Please,\" he said. \"In Paris _tout\nle monde_--everybody he think differently of those things--no?\" He\ntwisted uncomfortably. \"Please, you will not tell Marie, _n'est-ce\npas_?\"\n\nHarrison chuckled. \"None of my business,\" he said. \"One more question,\nJarvis. What was the one other thing you did before returning here?\"\n\nJarvis looked diffident. \"Oh--that.\" He hesitated. \"Well I sort of felt\nwe owed Tweel a lot, so after some trouble, we coaxed him into the\nrocket and sailed him out to the wreck of the first one, over on Thyle\nII. Then,\" he finished apologetically, \"I showed him the atomic blast,\ngot it working--and gave it to him!\"\n\n\"You _what_?\" roared the Captain. \"You turned something as powerful as\nthat over to an alien race--maybe some day as an enemy race?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Jarvis. \"Look here,\" he argued defensively. \"This\nlousy, dried-up pill of a desert called Mars'll never support much human\npopulation. The Sahara desert is just as good a field for imperialism,\nand a lot closer to home. So we'll never find Tweel's race enemies. The\nonly value we'll find here is commercial trade with the Martians. Then\nwhy shouldn't I give Tweel a chance for survival? With atomic energy,\nthey can run their canal system a hundred per cent instead of only one\nout of five, as Putz's observations showed. They can repopulate those\nghostly cities; they can resume their arts and industries; they can\ntrade with the nations of the earth--and I'll bet they can teach us a\nfew things,\" he paused, \"if they can figure out the atomic blast, and\nI'll lay odds they can. They're no fools, Tweel and his ostrich-faced\nMartians!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Valley of Dreams, by Stanley Grauman Weinbaum"}

At the end of Dane’s first flight the ship’s captain gains an opportunity to bid on a planet newly opened for possible trade and the crew goes all in to get the contract for a planet named Limbo. The information on the planet, which comes with the contract, does not look promising, but things look up a bit when a team of archaeologists hires Solar Queen to take them to Limbo.\nOn Limbo the archaeologists set up camp in the ruins of a Forerunner town, a trace of the people who ran a galactic empire long before humans ventured into space and who had wiped themselves out in an interstellar war. Dane and four others go exploring, to try to find intelligent life and potential trade goods. One of the group, Ali Kamil, disappears, apparently kidnapped by people using alien technology.\nSpooked, a group including Dane goes to the ruins to check up on the archaeologists and finds that they have disappeared. Suspicion has them return to Solar Queen by an alternate route and they begin to find wrecked spaceships, some from thousands of years previous, that show signs of having been looted. Approaching their landing site, they find Solar Queen under siege by pirates and they discern that the archaeologists are part of the pirate gang.\nWhile watching their ship from cover, Dane and his companions capture a pirate and invade the pirates’ underground base. There they find Forerunner technology still operating. In particular, they see two of the pirates operating a machine that draws in spaceships and crashes them on the planet. They also see signals indicating that one of the pirates’ own ships is being pursued by a Stellar Patrol cruiser.\nDane and his companions shut down the Forerunner base as the Patrol ship approaches and then try to fight their way out of the base. As the Solar Queen's crew engages the pirates in a blaster battle, the Patrol comes in and rescues them, putting a complete end to the pirates’ operation.\nThe Patrol insists that Solar Queen's crew give up their contract for Limbo, due to Forerunner artifacts, but they are allowed to take over the contract of one of the pirates’ victims, for trade with a planet called Sargol.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SARGASSO OF SPACE ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Greg Bergquist and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Transcriber's Note\n\n This etext was produced from Astounding Stories September 1931.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\n on this publication was renewed.\n\n[Illustration: She was floating along the wreck-pack's edge.]\n\n\n\n\nThe Sargasso of Space\n\n_By Edmond Hamilton_\n\n     Helpless, doomed, into the graveyard of space floats the wrecked\n     freighter _Pallas_.\n\n\nCaptain Crain faced his crew calmly. \"We may as well face the facts,\nmen,\" he said. \"The ship's fuel-tanks are empty and we are drifting\nthrough space toward the dead-area.\"\n\nThe twenty-odd officers and men gathered on the middle-deck of the\nfreighter _Pallas_ made no answer, and Crain continued:\n\n\"We left Jupiter with full tanks, more than enough fuel to take us to\nNeptune. But the leaks in the starboard tanks lost us half our supply,\nand we had used the other half before discovering that. Since the ship's\nrocket-tubes cannot operate without fuel, we are simply drifting. We\nwould drift on to Neptune if the attraction of Uranus were not pulling\nus to the right. That attraction alters our course so that in three\nship-days we shall drift into the dead-area.\"\n\nRance Kent, first-officer of the _Pallas_, asked a question: \"Couldn't\nwe, raise Neptune with the radio, sir, and have them send out a\nfuel-ship in time to reach us?\"\n\n\"It's impossible, Mr. Kent,\" Crain answered. \"Our main radio is dead\nwithout fuel to run its dynamotors, and our auxiliary set hasn't the\npower to reach Neptune.\"\n\n\"Why not abandon ship in the space-suits,\" asked Liggett, the\nsecond-officer, \"and trust to the chance of some ship picking us up?\"\n\nThe captain shook his head. \"It would be quite useless, for we'd simply\ndrift on through space with the ship into the dead-area.\"\n\nThe score of members of the crew, bronzed space-sailors out of every\nport in the solar system, had listened mutely. Now, one of them, a tall\ntube-man, stepped forward a little.\n\n\"Just what is this dead-area, sir?\" he asked. \"I've heard of it, but as\nthis is my first outer-planet voyage, I know nothing about it.\"\n\n\"I'll admit I know little more,\" said Liggett, \"save that a good many\ndisabled ships have drifted into it and have never come out.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"The dead area,\" Crain told them, \"is a region of space ninety thousand\nmiles across within Neptune's orbit, in which the ordinary gravitational\nattractions of the solar system are dead. This is because in that region\nthe pulls of the sun and the outer planets exactly balance each other.\nBecause of that, anything in the dead-area, will stay in there until\ntime ends, unless it has power of its own. Many wrecked space-ships have\ndrifted into it at one time or another, none ever emerging; and it's\nbelieved that there is a great mass of wrecks somewhere in the area,\ndrawn and held together by mutual attraction.\"\n\n\"And we're drifting in to join them,\" Kent said. \"Some prospect!\"\n\n\"Then there's really no chance for us?\" asked Liggett keenly.\n\nCaptain Crain thought. \"As I see it, very little,\" he admitted. \"If our\nauxiliary radio can reach some nearby ship before the _Pallas_ enters\nthe dead-area, we'll have a chance. But it seems a remote one.\"\n\nHe addressed himself to the men: \"I have laid the situation frankly\nbefore you because I consider you entitled to the truth. You must\nremember, however, that while there is life there is hope.\n\n\"There will be no change in ship routine, and the customary watches will\nbe kept. Half-rations of food and water will be the rule from now on,\nthough. That is all.\"\n\nAs the men moved silently off, the captain looked after them with\nsomething of pride.\n\n\"They're taking it like men,\" he told Kent and Liggett. \"It's a pity\nthere's no way out for them and us.\"\n\n\"If the _Pallas_ does enter the dead-area and join the wreck-pack,\"\nLiggett said, \"how long will we be able to live?\"\n\n\"Probably for some months on our present condensed air and food\nsupplies,\" Crain answered. \"I would prefer, myself, a quicker end.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said Kent. \"Well, there's nothing left but to pray for\nsome kind of ship to cross our path in the next day or two.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nKent's prayers were not answered in the next ship-day, nor in the next.\nFor, though one of the _Pallas'_ radio-operators was constantly at the\ninstruments under Captain Crain's orders, the weak calls of the\nauxiliary set raised no response.\n\nHad they been on the Venus or Mars run, Kent told himself, there would\nbe some chance, but out here in the vast spaces, between the outer\nplanets, ships were fewer and farther between. The big, cigar-shaped\nfreighter drifted helplessly on in a broad curve toward the dreaded\narea, the green light-speck of Neptune swinging to their left.\n\nOn the third ship-day Kent and Captain Crain stood in the pilot-house\nbehind Liggett, who sat at the now useless rocket-tube controls. Their\neyes were on the big glass screen of the gravograph. The black dot on it\nthat represented their ship was crawling steadily toward the bright red\ncircle that stood for the dead-area....\n\nThey watched silently until the dot had crawled over the circle's red\nline, heading toward its center.\n\n\"Well, we're in at last,\" Kent commented. \"There seems to be no change\nin anything, either.\"\n\nCrain pointed to the instrument-panel. \"Look at the gravitometers.\"\n\nKent did. \"All dead! No gravitational pull from any direction--no, that\none shows a slight attraction from ahead!\"\n\n\"Then gravitational attraction of some sort does exist in the dead-area\nafter all!\" Liggett exclaimed.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Crain. \"That attraction from ahead is the\npull of the wreck-pack at the dead-area's center.\"\n\n\"And it's pulling the _Pallas_ toward it?\" Kent exclaimed.\n\nCrain nodded. \"We'll probably reach the wreck-pack in two more\nship-days.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe next two ship-days seemed to Kent drawn out endlessly. A moody\nsilence had grown upon the officers and men of the ship. All seemed\noppressed by the strange forces of fate that had seized the ship and\nwere carrying it, smoothly and soundlessly, into this region of\nirrevocable doom.\n\nThe radio-operators' vain calls had ceased. The _Pallas_ drifted on into\nthe dreaded area like some dumb ship laden with damned souls. It drifted\non, Kent told himself, as many a wrecked and disabled ship had done\nbefore it, with the ordinary activities and life of the solar system\nforever behind it, and mystery and death ahead.\n\nIt was toward the end of the second of those two ship-days that\nLiggett's voice came down from the pilot-house:\n\n\"Wreck-pack in sight ahead!\"\n\n\"We've arrived, anyway!\" Kent cried, as he and Crain hastened up into\nthe pilot house. The crew was running to the deck-windows.\n\n\"Right ahead there, about fifteen degrees left,\" Liggett told Kent and\nCrain, pointing. \"Do you see it?\"\n\nKent stared; nodded. The wreck-pack was a distant, disk-like mass\nagainst the star-flecked heavens, a mass that glinted here and there in\nthe feeble sunlight of space. It did not seem large, but, as they\ndrifted steadily closer in the next hours, they saw that in reality the\nwreck-pack was tremendous, measuring at least fifty miles across.\n\nIts huge mass was a heterogeneous heap, composed mostly of countless\ncigar-like space-ships in all stages of wreckage. Some appeared smashed\nalmost out of all recognizable shape, while others were, to all\nappearances unharmed. They floated together in this dense mass in space,\ncrowded against one another by their mutual attraction.\n\nThere seemed to be among them every type of ship known in the solar\nsystem, from small, swift mail-boats to big freighters. And, as they\ndrifted nearer, the three in the pilot-house could see that around and\nbetween the ships of the wreck-pack floated much other matter--fragments\nof wreckage, meteors, small and large, and space-debris of every sort.\n\nThe _Pallas_ was drifting, not straight toward the wreck-pack, but in a\ncourse that promised to take the ship past it.\n\n\"We're not heading into the wreck-pack!\" Liggett exclaimed. \"Maybe we'll\ndrift past it, and on out the dead-area's other side!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCaptain Crain smiled mirthlessly. \"You're forgetting your\nspace-mechanics, Liggett. We will drift along the wreck-pack's edge, and\nthen will curve in and go round it in a closing spiral until we reach\nits edge.\"\n\n\"Lord, who'd have thought there were so many wrecks here!\" Kent\nmarvelled. \"There must be thousands of them!\"\n\n\"They've been collecting here ever since the first interplanetary\nrocket-ships went forth,\" Crain reminded him. \"Not only meteor-wrecked\nships, but ships whose mechanisms went wrong--or that ran out of fuel\nlike ours--or that were captured and sacked, and then set adrift by\nspace-pirates.\"\n\nThe _Pallas_ by then was drifting along the wreck-pack's rim at a\nhalf-mile distance, and Kent's eyes were running over the mass.\n\n\"Some of those ships look entirely undamaged. Why couldn't we find one\nthat has fuel in its tanks, transfer it to our own tanks, and get away?\"\nhe asked.\n\nCrain's eyes lit. \"Kent, that's a real chance! There must be some ships\nin that pack with fuel in them, and we can use the space-suits to\nexplore for them!\"\n\n\"Look, we're beginning to curve in around the pack now!\" Liggett\nexclaimed.\n\nThe _Pallas_, as though loath to pass the wreck-pack, was curving\ninward to follow its rim. In the next hours it continued to sail slowly\naround the great pack, approaching closer and closer to its edge.\n\nIn those hours Kent and Crain and all in the ship watched with a\nfascinated interest that even knowledge of their own peril could not\nkill. They could see swift-lined passenger-ships of the Pluto and\nNeptune runs shouldering against small space-yachts with the insignia of\nMars or Venus on their bows. Wrecked freighters from Saturn or Earth\nfloated beside rotund grain-boats from Jupiter.\n\nThe debris among the pack's wrecks was just as varied, holding fragments\nof metal, dark meteors of differing size--and many human bodies. Among\nthese were some clad in the insulated space-suits, with their\ntransparent glassite helmets. Kent wondered what wreck they had\nabandoned hastily in those suits, only to be swept with it into the\ndead-area, to die in their suits.\n\nBy the end of that ship-day, the _Pallas_, having floated almost\ncompletely around the wreck-pack, finally struck the wrecks at its edge\nwith a jarring shock; then bobbed for a while and lay still. From\npilot-house and deck windows the men looked eagerly forth.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nTheir ship floated at the wreck-pack's edge. Directly to its right\nfloated a sleek, shining Uranus-Jupiter passenger-ship whose bows had\nbeen smashed in by a meteor. On their left bobbed an unmarked freighter\nof the old type with projecting rocket-tubes, apparently intact. Beyond\nthem in the wreck-pack lay another Uranus craft, a freighter, and,\nbeyond it, stretched the countless other wrecks.\n\nCaptain Crain summoned the crew together again on the middle-deck.\n\n\"Men, we've reached the wreck-pack at the dead-area's center, and here\nwe'll stay until the end of time unless we get out under our own power.\nMr. Kent has suggested a possible way of doing so, which I consider\nhighly feasible.\n\n\"He has suggested that in some of the ships in the wreck-pack may be\nfound enough fuel to enable us to escape from the dead-area, once it is\ntransferred to this ship. I am going to permit him to explore the\nwreck-pack with a party in space suits, and I am asking for volunteers\nfor this service.\"\n\nThe entire crew stepped quickly forward. Crain smiled. \"Twelve of you\nwill be enough,\" he told them. \"The eight tube-men and four of the\ncargo-men will go, therefore, with Mr. Kent and Mr. Liggett as leaders.\nMr. Kent, you may address the men if you wish.\"\n\n\"Get down to the lower airlock and into your space-suits at once, then,\"\nKent told them. \"Mr. Liggett, will you supervise that?\"\n\nAs Liggett and the men trooped down to the airlock, Kent turned back\ntoward his superior.\n\n\"There's a very real chance of your becoming lost in this huge\nwreck-pack, Kent,\" Crain told him: \"so be very careful to keep your\nbearings at all times. I know I can depend on you.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" Kent was saying, when Liggett's excited face\nreappeared suddenly at the stair.\n\n\"There are men coming toward the _Pallas_ along the wreck-pack's edge!\"\nhe reported--\"a half-dozen men in space-suits!\"\n\n\"You must be mistaken, Liggett!\" exclaimed Crain. \"They must be some of\nthe bodies in space-suits we saw in the pack.\"\n\n\"No, they're living men!\" Liggett cried. \"They're coming straight toward\nus--come down and see!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCrain and Kent followed Liggett quickly down to the airlock room, where\nthe men who had started donning their space-suits were now peering\nexcitedly from the windows. Crain and Kent looked where Liggett pointed,\nalong the wreck-pack's edge to the ship's right.\n\nSix floating shapes, men in space-suits, were approaching along the\npack's border. They floated smoothly through space, reaching the wrecked\npassenger-ship beside the _Pallas_. They braced their feet against its\nside and propelled themselves on through the void like swimmers under\nwater, toward the _Pallas_.\n\n\"They must be survivors from some wreck that drifted in here as we did!\"\nKent exclaimed. \"Maybe they've lived here for months!\"\n\n\"It's evident that they saw the _Pallas_ drift into the pack, and have\ncome to investigate,\" Crain estimated. \"Open the airlock for them, men,\nfor they'll want to come inside.\"\n\nTwo of the men spun the wheels that slid aside the airlock's outer door.\nIn a moment the half-dozen men outside had reached the ship's side, and\nhad pulled themselves down inside the airlock.\n\nWhen all were in, the outer door was closed, and air hissed in to fill\nthe lock. The airlock's inner door then slid open and the newcomers\nstepped into the ship's interior, unscrewing their transparent helmets\nas they did so. For a few moments the visitors silently surveyed their\nnew surroundings.\n\nTheir leader was a swarthy individual with sardonic black eyes who, on\nnoticing Crain's captain-insignia, came toward him with outstretched\nhand. His followers seemed to be cargo-men or deck-men, looking hardly\nintelligent enough to Kent's eyes to be tube-men.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Welcome to our city!\" their leader exclaimed as he shook Crain's hand.\n\"We saw your ship drift in, but hardly expected to find anyone living in\nit.\"\n\n\"I'll confess that we're surprised ourselves to find any life here,\"\nCrain told him. \"You're living on one of the wrecks?\"\n\nThe other nodded. \"Yes, on the _Martian Queen_, a quarter-mile along the\npack's edge. It was a Saturn-Neptune passenger ship, and about a month\nago we were at this cursed dead-area's edge, when half our rocket-tubes\nexploded. Eighteen of us escaped the explosion, the ship's walls still\nbeing tight; and we drifted into the pack here, and have been living\nhere ever since.\"\n\n\"My name's Krell,\" he added, \"and I was a tube-man on the ship. I and\nanother of the tube-men, named Jandron, were the highest in rank left,\nall the officers and other tube-men having been killed, so we took\ncharge and have been keeping order.\"\n\n\"What about your passengers?\" Liggett asked.\n\n\"All killed but one,\" Krell answered. \"When the tubes let go they\nsmashed up the whole lower two decks.\"\n\nCrain briefly explained to him the _Pallas'_ predicament. \"Mr. Kent and\nMr. Liggett were on the point of starting a search of the wreck-pack for\nfuel when you arrived,\" he said, \"With enough fuel we can get clear of\nthe dead-area.\"\n\nKrell's eyes lit up. \"That would mean a getaway for all of us! It surely\nought to be possible!\"\n\n\"Do you know whether there are any ships in the pack with fuel in their\ntanks?\" Kent asked. Krell shook his head.\n\n\"We've searched through the wreck-pack a good bit, but never bothered\nabout fuel, it being no good to us. But there ought to be some, at\nleast: there's enough wrecks in this cursed place to make it possible\nto find almost anything.\n\n\"You'd better not start exploring, though,\" he added, \"without some of\nus along as guides, for I'm here to tell you that you can lose yourself\nin this wreck-pack without knowing it. If you wait until to-morrow, I'll\ncome over myself and go with you.\"\n\n\"I think that would be wise,\" Crain said to Kent. \"There is plenty of\ntime.\"\n\n\"Time is the one thing there's plenty of in this damned place,\" Krell\nagreed. \"We'll be getting back to the _Martian Queen_ now and give the\ngood news to Jandron and the rest.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't mind if Liggett and I came along, would you?\" Kent asked. \"I'd\nlike to see how your ship's fixed--that is, if it's all right with you,\nsir,\" he added to his superior.\n\nCrain nodded. \"All right if you don't stay long,\" he said. But, to\nKent's surprise Krell seemed reluctant to endorse his proposal.\n\n\"I guess it'll be all right,\" he said slowly, \"though there's nothing\nmuch on the _Martian Queen_ to see.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nKrell and his followers replaced their helmets and returned into the\nairlock. Liggett followed them, and, as Kent struggled hastily into a\nspace-suit, he found Captain Crain at his side.\n\n\"Kent, look sharp when you get over on that ship,\" Crain told him. \"I\ndon't like the look of this Krell, and his story about all the officers\nbeing killed in the explosion sounds fishy to me.\"\n\n\"To me, too,\" Kent agreed. \"But Liggett and I will have the suit-phones\nin our space-suits and can call you from there in case of need.\"\n\nCrain nodded, and Kent with space-suit on and transparent helmet\nscrewed tight, stepped into the airlock with the rest. The airlock's\ninner door closed, the outer one opened, and as the air puffed out into\nspace, Kent and Krell and Liggett leapt out into the void, the others\nfollowing.\n\nIt was no novelty to Kent to float in a space-suit in the empty void. He\nand the others now floated as smoothly as though under water toward a\nwrecked liner at the _Pallas'_ right. They reached it, pulled themselves\naround it, and, with feet braced against its side, propelled themselves\non through space along the border of the wreck-pack.\n\nThey passed a half-dozen wrecks thus, before coming to the _Martian\nQueen_. It was a silvery, glistening ship whose stern and lower walls\nwere bulging and strained, but not cracked. Kent told himself that Krell\nhad spoken truth about the exploding rocket-tubes, at least.\n\nThey struck the _Martian Queen's_ side and entered the upper-airlock\nopen for them. Once through the airlock they found themselves on the\nship's upper-deck. And when Kent and Liggett removed their helmets with\nthe others they found a full dozen men confronting them, a brutal-faced\ngroup who exhibited some surprise at sight of them.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nForemost among them stood a tall, heavy individual who regarded Kent and\nLiggett with the cold, suspicious eyes of an animal.\n\n\"My comrade and fellow-ruler here, Wald Jandron,\" said Krell. To Jandron\nhe explained rapidly. \"The whole crew of the _Pallas_ is alive, and they\nsay if they can find fuel in the wreck-pack their ship can get out of\nhere.\"\n\n\"Good,\" grunted Jandron. \"The sooner they can do it, the better it will\nbe for us.\"\n\nKent saw Liggett flush angrily, but he ignored Jandron and spoke to\nKrell. \"You said one of your passengers had escaped the explosion?\"\n\nTo Kent's amazement a girl stepped from behind the group of men, a slim\ngirl with pale face and steady, dark eyes. \"I'm the passenger,\" she told\nhim. \"My name's Marta Mallen.\"\n\nKent and Liggett stared, astounded. \"Good Lord!\" Kent exclaimed. \"A girl\nlike you on this ship!\"\n\n\"Miss Mallen happened to be on the upper-deck at the time of the\nexplosion and, so, escaped when the other passengers were killed,\" Krell\nexplained smoothly. \"Isn't that so, Miss Mallen?\"\n\nThe girl's eyes had not left Kent's, but at Krell's words she nodded.\n\"Yes, that is so,\" she said mechanically.\n\nKent collected his whirling thoughts. \"But wouldn't you rather go back\nto the _Pallas_ with us?\" he asked. \"I'm sure you'd be more comfortable\nthere.\"\n\n\"She doesn't go,\" grunted Jandron. Kent turned in quick wrath toward\nhim, but Krell intervened.\n\n\"Jandron only means that Miss Mallen is much more comfortable on this\npassenger-ship than she'd be in your freighter.\" He shot a glance at the\ngirl as he spoke, and Kent saw her wince.\n\n\"I'm afraid that's so,\" she said; \"but I thank you for the offer, Mr.\nKent.\"\n\nKent could have sworn that there was an appeal in her eyes, and he stood\nfor a moment, indecisive, Jandron's stare upon him. After a moment's\nthought he turned to Krell.\n\n\"You were going to show me the damage the exploding tubes did,\" he said,\nand Krell nodded quickly.\n\n\"Of course; you can see from the head of the stair back in the\nafter-deck.\"\n\nHe led the way along a corridor, Jandron and the girl and two of the\nmen coming with them. Kent's thoughts were still chaotic as he walked\nbetween Krell and Liggett. What was this girl doing amid the men of the\n_Martian Queen_? What had her eyes tried to tell him?\n\nLiggett nudged his side in the dim corridor, and Kent, looking down, saw\ndark splotches on its metal floor. Blood-stains! His suspicions\nstrengthened. They might be from the bleeding of those wounded in the\ntube-explosions. But were they?\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey reached the after-deck whose stair's head gave a view of the\nwrecked tube-rooms beneath. The lower decks had been smashed by terrific\nforces. Kent's practiced eyes ran rapidly over the shattered\nrocket-tubes.\n\n\"They've back-blasted from being fired too fast,\" he said. \"Who was\ncontrolling the ship when this happened?\"\n\n\"Galling, our second-officer,\" answered Krell. \"He had found us routed\ntoo close to the dead-area's edge and was trying to get away from it in\na hurry, when he used the tubes too fast, and half of them\nback-blasted.\"\n\n\"If Galling was at the controls in the pilot-house, how did the\nexplosion kill him?\" asked Liggett skeptically. Krell turned quickly.\n\n\"The shock threw him against the pilot-house wall and fractured his\nskull--he died in an hour,\" he said. Liggett was silent.\n\n\"Well, this ship will never move again,\" Kent said. \"It's too bad that\nthe explosion blew out your tanks, but we ought to find fuel somewhere\nin the wreck-pack for the _Pallas_. And now we'd best get back.\"\n\nAs they returned up the dim corridor Kent managed to walk beside Marta\nMallen, and, without being seen, he contrived to detach his\nsuit-phone--the compact little radiophone case inside his space-suit's\nneck--and slip it into the girl's grasp. He dared utter no word of\nexplanation, but apparently she understood, for she had concealed the\nsuit-phone by the time they reached the upper-deck.\n\nKent and Liggett prepared to don their space-helmets, and before\nentering the airlock, Kent turned to Krell.\n\n\"We'll expect you at the _Pallas_ first hour to-morrow, and we'll start\nsearching the wreck-pack with a dozen of our men,\" he said.\n\nHe then extended his hand to the girl. \"Good-by, Miss Mallen. I hope we\ncan have a talk soon.\"\n\nHe had said the words with double meaning, and saw understanding in her\neyes. \"I hope we can, too,\" she said.\n\nKent's nod to Jandron went unanswered, and he and Liggett adjusted their\nhelmets and entered the airlock.\n\nOnce out of it, they kicked rapidly away from the _Martian Queen_,\nfloating along with the wreck-pack's huge mass to their right, and only\nthe star-flecked emptiness of infinity to their left. In a few minutes\nthey reached the airlock of the _Pallas_.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey found Captain Crain awaiting them anxiously. Briefly Kent reported\neverything.\n\n\"I'm certain there has been foul play aboard the _Martian Queen_,\" he\nsaid. \"Krell you saw for yourself, Jandron is pure brute, and their men\nseem capable of anything.\n\n\"I gave the suit-phone to the girl, however, and if she can call us with\nit, we can get the truth from her. She dared not tell me anything there\nin the presence of Krell and Jandron.\"\n\nCrain nodded, his face grave. \"We'll see whether or not she calls,\" he\nsaid.\n\nKent took a suit-phone from one of their space-suits and rapidly, tuned\nit to match the one he had left with Marta Mallen. Almost at once they\nheard her voice from it, and Kent answered rapidly.\n\n\"I'm so glad I got you!\" she exclaimed. \"Mr. Kent, I dared not tell you\nthe truth about this ship when you were here, or Krell and the rest\nwould have killed you at once.\"\n\n\"I thought that was it, and that's why I left the suit-phone for you,\"\nKent said. \"Just what is the truth?\"\n\n\"Krell and Jandron and these men of theirs are the ones who killed the\nofficers and passengers of the _Martian Queen_! What they told you about\nthe explosion was true enough, for the explosion did happen that way,\nand because of it, the ship drifted into the dead-area. But the only\nones killed by it were some of the tube-men and three passengers.\n\n\"Then, while the ship was drifting into the dead-area, Krell told the\nmen that the fewer aboard, the longer they could live on the ship's food\nand air. Krell and Jandron led the men in a surprise attack and killed\nall the officers and passengers, and threw their bodies out into space.\nI was the only passenger they spared, because both Krell and\nJandron--want me!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThere was a silence, and Kent felt a red anger rising in him. \"Have they\ndared harm you?\" he asked after a moment.\n\n\"No, for Krell and Jandron are too jealous of each other to permit the\nother to touch me. But it's been terrible living with them in this awful\nplace.\"\n\n\"Ask her if she knows what their plans are in regard to us,\" Crain told\nKent.\n\nMarta had apparently overheard the question. \"I don't know that, for\nthey shut me in my cabin as soon as you left,\" she said. \"I've heard\nthem talking and arguing excitedly, though. I know that if you do find\nfuel, they'll try to kill you all and escape from here in your ship.\"\n\n\"Pleasant prospect,\" Kent commented. \"Do you think they plan an attack\non us now?\"\n\n\"No; I think that they'll wait until you've refueled your ship, if you\nare able to do that, and then try treachery.\"\n\n\"Well, they'll find us ready. Miss Mallen, you have the suit-phone: keep\nit hidden in your cabin and I'll call you first thing to-morrow. We're\ngoing to get you out of there, but we don't want to break with Krell\nuntil we're ready. Will you be all right until then?\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" she answered. \"There's another thing, though. My\nname isn't Miss Mallen--it's Marta.\"\n\n\"Mine's Rance,\" said Kent, smiling. \"Good-by until to-morrow, then,\nMarta.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Rance.\"\n\nKent rose from the instrument with the smile still in his eyes, but with\nhis lips compressed. \"Damn it, there's the bravest and finest girl in\nthe solar system!\" he exclaimed. \"Over there with those brutes!\"\n\n\"We'll have her out, never fear,\" Crain reassured him. \"The main thing\nis to determine our course toward Krell and Jandron.\"\n\nKent thought. \"As I see it, Krell can help us immeasurably in our search\nthrough the wreck-pack for fuel,\" he said. \"I think it would be best to\nkeep on good terms with him until we've found fuel and have it in our\ntanks. Then we can turn the tables on them before they can do anything.\"\n\nCrain nodded thoughtfully. \"I think you're right. Then you and Liggett\nand Krell can head our search-party to-morrow.\"\n\nCrain established watches on a new schedule, and Kent and Liggett and\nthe dozen men chosen for the exploring party of the next day ate a\nscanty meal and turned in for some sleep.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nWhen Kent woke and glimpsed the massed wrecks through the window he was\nfor the moment amazed, but rapidly remembered. He and Liggett were\nfinishing their morning ration when Crain pointed to a window.\n\n\"There comes Krell now,\" he said, indicating the single space-suited\nfigure approaching along the wreck-pack's edge.\n\n\"I'll call Marta before he gets here,\" said Kent hastily.\n\nThe girl answered on the suit-phone immediately, and it occurred to Kent\nthat she must have spent the night without sleeping. \"Krell left a few\nminutes ago,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, he's coming now. You heard nothing of their plans?\"\n\n\"No; they've kept me shut in my cabin. However, I did hear Krell giving\nJandron and the rest directions. I'm sure they're plotting something.\"\n\n\"We're prepared for them,\" Kent assured her. \"If all goes well, before\nyou realize it, you'll be sailing out of here with us in the _Pallas_.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" she said. \"Rance, be careful with Krell in the wreck-pack.\nHe's dangerous.\"\n\n\"I'll be watching him,\" he promised. \"Good-by, Marta.\"\n\nKent reached the lower-deck just as Krell entered from the airlock, his\nswarthy face smiling as he removed his helmet. He carried a pointed\nsteel bar. Liggett and the others were donning their suits.\n\n\"All ready to go, Kent?\" Krell asked.\n\nKent nodded. \"All ready,\" he said shortly. Since hearing Marta's story\nhe found it hard to dissimulate with Krell.\n\n\"You'll want bars like mine,\" Krell continued, \"for they're damned\nhandy when you get jammed between wreckage masses. Exploring this\nwreck-pack is no soft job: I can tell you from experience.\"\n\nLiggett and the rest had their suits adjusted, and with bars in their\ngrasp, followed Krell into the airlock. Kent hung back for a last word\nwith Crain, who, with his half-dozen remaining men, was watching.\n\n\"Marta just told me that Krell and Jandron have been plotting\nsomething,\" he told the captain; \"so I'd keep a close watch outside.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Kent. We'll let no one inside the _Pallas_ until you and\nLiggett and the men get back.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nIn a few minutes they were out of the ship, with Krell and Kent and\nLiggett leading, and the twelve members of the _Pallas'_ crew following\nclosely.\n\nThe three leaders climbed up on the Uranus-Jupiter passenger-ship that\nlay beside the _Pallas_, the others moving on and exploring the\nneighboring wrecks in parties of two and three. From the top of the\npassenger-ship, when they gained it, Kent and his two companions could\nlook far out over the wreck-pack. It was an extraordinary spectacle,\nthis stupendous mass of dead ships floating motionless in the depths of\nspace, with the burning stars above and below them.\n\nHis companions and the other men clambering over the neighboring wrecks\nseemed weird figures in their bulky suits and transparent helmets. Kent\nlooked back at the _Pallas_, and then along the wreck-pack's edge to\nwhere he could glimpse the silvery side of the _Martian Queen_. But now\nKrell and Liggett were descending into the ship's interior through the\ngreat opening smashed in its bows, and Kent followed.\n\nThey found themselves in the liner's upper navigation-rooms. Officers\nand men lay about, frozen to death at the instant the meteor-struck\nvessel's air had rushed out, and the cold of space had entered. Krell\nled the way on, down into the ship's lower decks, where they found the\nbodies of the crew and passengers lying in the same silent death.\n\nThe salons held beautifully-dressed women, distinguished-looking men,\nlying about as the meteor's shock had hurled them. One group lay around\na card-table, their game interrupted. A woman still held a small child,\nboth seemingly asleep. Kent tried to shake off the oppression he felt as\nhe and Krell and Liggett continued down to the tank-rooms.\n\nThey found their quest there useless, for the tanks had been strained by\nthe meteor's shock, and were empty. Kent felt Liggett grasp his hand and\nheard him speak, the sound-vibrations coming through their contacting\nsuits.\n\n\"Nothing here; and we'll find it much the same through all these wrecks,\nif I'm not wrong. Tanks always give at a shock.\"\n\n\"There must be some ships with fuel still in them among all these,\" Kent\nanswered.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey climbed back, up to the ship's top, and leapt off it toward a\nJupiter freighter lying a little farther inside the pack. As they\nfloated toward it, Kent saw their men moving on with them from ship to\nship, progressing inward into the pack. Both Kent and Liggett kept Krell\nalways ahead of them, knowing that a blow from his bar, shattering their\nglassite helmets, meant instant death. But Krell seemed quite intent on\nthe search for fuel.\n\nThe big Jupiter freighter seemed intact from above, but, when they\npenetrated into it, they found its whole under-side blown away,\napparently by an explosion of its tanks. They moved on to the next ship,\na private space-yacht, small in size, but luxurious in fittings. It had\nbeen abandoned in space, its rocket-tubes burst and tanks strained.\n\nThey went on, working deeper into the wreck-pack. Kent almost forgot the\nparamount importance of their search in the fascination of it. They\nexplored almost every known type of ship--freighters, liners,\ncold-storage boats, and grain-boats. Once Kent's hopes ran high at sight\nof a fuel-ship, but it proved to be in ballast, its cargo-tanks empty\nand its own tanks and tubes apparently blown simultaneously.\n\nKent's muscles ached from the arduous work of climbing over and\nexploring the wrecks. He and Liggett had become accustomed to the sight\nof frozen, motionless bodies.\n\nAs they worked deeper into the pack, they noticed that the ships were of\nincreasingly older types, and at last Krell signalled a halt. \"We're\nalmost a mile in,\" he told them, gripping their hands. \"We'd better work\nback out, taking a different section of the pack as we do.\"\n\nKent nodded. \"It may change our luck,\" he said.\n\nIt did; for when they had gone not more than a half-mile back, they\nglimpsed one of their men waving excitedly from the top of a Pluto\nliner.\n\nThey hastened at once toward him, the other men gathering also; and when\nKent grasped the man's hand he heard his excited voice.\n\n\"Fuel-tanks here are more than half-full, sir!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey descended quickly into the liner, finding that though its whole\nstern had been sheared away by a meteor, its tanks had remained\nmiraculously unstrained.\n\n\"Enough fuel here to take the _Pallas_ to Neptune!\" Kent exclaimed.\n\n\"How will you get it over to your ship?\" Krell asked. Kent pointed to\ngreat reels of flexible metal tubing hanging near the tanks.\n\n\"We'll pump it over. The _Pallas_ has tubing like this ship's, for\ntaking on fuel in space, and, by joining its tubing to this, we'll have\na tube-line between the two ships. It's hardly more than a\nquarter-mile.\"\n\n\"Let's get back and let them know about it,\" Liggett urged, and they\nclimbed back out of the liner.\n\nThey worked their way out of the wreck-pack with much greater speed than\nthat with which they had entered, needing only an occasional brace\nagainst a ship's side to send them floating over the wrecks. They came\nto the wreck-pack's edge at a little distance from the _Pallas_, and\nhastened toward it.\n\nThey found the outer door of the _Pallas'_ airlock open, and entered,\nKrell remaining with them. As the outer door closed and air hissed into\nthe lock, Kent and the rest removed their helmets. The inner door slid\nopen as they were doing this, and from inside almost a score of men\nleapt upon them!\n\nKent, stunned for a moment, saw Jandron among their attackers, bellowing\norders to them, and even as he struck out furiously he comprehended.\nJandron and the men of the _Martian Queen_ had somehow captured the\n_Pallas_ from Crain and had been awaiting their return!\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe struggle was almost instantly over, for, outnumbered and hampered as\nthey were by their heavy space-suits, Kent and Liggett and their\nfollowers had no chance. Their hands, still in the suits, were bound\nquickly behind them at Jandron's orders.\n\nKent heard an exclamation, and saw Marta starting toward him from\nbehind Jandron's men. But a sweep of Jandron's arm brushed her rudely\nback. Kent strained madly at his bonds. Krell's face had a triumphant\nlook.\n\n\"Did it all work as I told you it would, Jandron?\" he asked.\n\n\"It worked,\" Jandron answered impassively. \"When they saw fifteen of us\ncoming from the wreck-pack in space-suits, they opened right up to us.\"\n\nKent understood, and cursed Krell's cunning. Crain, seeing the fifteen\nfigures approaching from the wreck-pack, had naturally thought they were\nKent's party, and had let them enter to overwhelm his half-dozen men.\n\n\"We put Crain and his men over in the _Martian Queen_,\" Jandron\ncontinued, \"and took all their helmets so they can't escape. The girl we\nbrought over here. Did you find a wreck with fuel?\"\n\nKrell nodded. \"A Pluto liner a quarter-mile back, and we can pump the\nfuel over here by connecting tube-lines. What the devil--\"\n\nJandron had made a signal at which three of his men had leapt forward on\nKrell, securing his hands like those of the others.\n\n\"Have you gone crazy, Jandron?\" cried Krell, his face red with anger and\nsurprise.\n\n\"No,\" Jandron replied impassively; \"but the men are as tired as I am of\nyour bossing ways, and have chosen me as their sole leader.\"\n\n\"You dirty double-crosser!\" Krell raged. \"Are you men going to let him\nget away with this?\"\n\nThe men paid no attention, and Jandron motioned to the airlock. \"Take\nthem over to the _Martian Queen_ too,\" he ordered, \"and make sure\nthere's no space-helmet left there. Then get back at once, for we've got\nto get the fuel into this ship and make a getaway.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe helmets of Kent and Krell and the other helpless prisoners were put\nupon them, and, with hands still bound, they were herded into the\nairlock by eight of Jandron's men attired in space-suits also. The\nprisoners were then joined one to another by a strand of metal cable.\n\nKent, glancing back into the ship as the airlock's inner door closed,\nsaw Jandron giving rapid orders to his followers, and noticed Marta held\nback from the airlock by one of them. Krell's eyes glittered venomously\nthrough his helmet. The outer door opened, and their guards jerked them\nforth into space by the connecting cable.\n\nThey were towed helplessly along the wreck-pack's rim toward the\n_Martian Queen_. Once inside its airlock, Jandron's men removed the\nprisoners' space-helmets and then used the duplicate-control inside the\nairlock itself to open the inner door. Through this opening they thrust\nthe captives, those inside the ship not daring to enter the airlock.\nJandron's men then closed the inner door, re-opened the outer one, and\nstarted back toward the _Pallas_ with the helmets of Kent and his\ncompanions.\n\nKent and the others soon found Crain and his half-dozen men who rapidly\nundid their bonds. Crain's men still wore their space-suits, but, like\nKent's companions, were without space-helmets.\n\n\"Kent, I was afraid they'd get you and your men too!\" Crain exclaimed.\n\"It's all my fault, for when I saw Jandron and his men coming from the\nwreck-pack I never doubted but that it was you.\"\n\n\"It's no one's fault,\" Kent told him. \"It's just something that we\ncouldn't foresee.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCrain's eyes fell on Krell. \"But what's he doing here?\" he exclaimed.\nKent briefly explained Jandron's treachery toward Krell, and Crain's\nbrows drew ominously together.\n\n\"So Jandron put you here with us! Krell, I am a commissioned captain of\na space-ship, and as such can legally try you and sentence you to death\nhere without further formalities.\"\n\nKrell did not answer, but Kent intervened. \"There's hardly time for that\nnow, sir,\" he said. \"I'm as anxious to settle with Krell as anyone, but\nright now our main enemy is Jandron, and Krell hates Jandron worse than\nwe do, if I'm not mistaken.\"\n\n\"You're not,\" said Krell grimly. \"All I want right now is to get within\nreach of Jandron.\"\n\n\"There's small chance of any of us doing that,\" Crain told them.\n\"There's not a single space-helmet on the _Martian Queen_.\"\n\n\"You've searched?\" Liggett asked.\n\n\"Every cubic inch of the ship,\" Crain told him. \"No, Jandron's men made\nsure there were no helmets left here, and without helmets this ship is\nan inescapable prison.\"\n\n\"Damn it, there must be some way out!\" Kent exclaimed. \"Why, Jandron and\nhis men must be starting to pump that fuel into the _Pallas_ by now!\nThey'll be sailing off as soon as they do it!\"\n\nCrain's face was sad. \"I'm afraid this is the end, Kent. Without\nhelmets, the space between the _Martian Queen_ and the _Pallas_ is a\ngreater barrier to us than a mile-thick wall of steel. In this ship\nwe'll stay, until the air and food give out, and death releases us.\"\n\n\"Damn it, I'm not thinking of myself!\" Kent cried. \"I'm thinking of\nMarta! The _Pallas_ will sail out of here with her in Jandron's power!\"\n\n\"The girl!\" Liggett exclaimed. \"If she could bring us over space-helmets\nfrom the _Pallas_ we could get out of here!\"\n\nKent was thoughtful. \"If we could talk to her--she must still have that\nsuit-phone I gave her. Where's another?\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCrain quickly detached the compact suit-phone from inside the neck of\nhis own space-suit, and Kent rapidly tuned it to the one he had given\nMarta Mallen. His heart leapt as her voice came instantly from it:\n\n\"Rance! Rance Kent--\"\n\n\"Marta--this is Rance!\" he cried.\n\nHe heard a sob of relief. \"I've been calling you for minutes! I was\nhoping that you'd remember to listen!\n\n\"Jandron and ten of the others have gone to that wreck in which you\nfound the fuel,\" she added swiftly. \"They unreeled a tube-line behind\nthem as they went, and I can hear them pumping in the fuel now.\"\n\n\"Are the others guarding you?\" Kent asked quickly.\n\n\"They're down in the lower deck at the tanks and airlocks. They won't\nallow me down on that deck. I'm up here in the middle-deck, absolutely\nalone.\n\n\"Jandron told me that we'd start out of here as soon as the fuel was\nin,\" she added, \"and he and the men were laughing about Krell.\"\n\n\"Marta, could you in any way get space-helmets and get out to bring them\nover here to us?\" Kent asked eagerly.\n\n\"There's a lot of space-suits and helmets here,\" she answered, \"but I\ncouldn't get out with them, Rance! I couldn't get to the airlocks with\nJandron's seven or eight men down there guarding them!\"\n\nKent felt despair; then as an idea suddenly flamed in him, he almost\nshouted into the instrument:\n\n\"Marta, unless you can get over here with helmets for us, we're all\nlost. I want you to put on a space-suit and helmet at once!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThere was a short silence, and then her voice came, a little muffled.\n\"I've got the suit and helmet on, Rance. I'm wearing the suit-phone\ninside it.\"\n\n\"Good! Now, can you get up to the pilot-house? There's no one guarding\nit or the upper-deck? Hurry up there, then, at once.\"\n\nCrain and the rest were staring at Kent. \"Kent, what are you going to\nhave her do?\" Crain exclaimed. \"It'll do no good for her to start the\n_Pallas_: those guards will be up there in a minute!\"\n\n\"I'm not going to have her start the _Pallas_,\" said Kent grimly.\n\"Marta, you're in the pilot-house? Do you see the heavy little steel\ndoor in the wall beside the instrument-panel?\"\n\n\"I'm at it, but it's locked with a combination-lock,\" she said.\n\n\"The combination is 6-34-77-81,\" Kent told her swiftly. \"Open it as\nquickly as you can.\"\n\n\"Good God, Kent!\" cried Crain. \"You're going to have her--?\"\n\n\"Get out of there the only way she can!\" Kent finished fiercely. \"You\nhave the door open, Marta?\"\n\n\"Yes; there are six or seven control-wheels inside.\"\n\n\"Those wheels control the _Pallas'_ exhaust-valves,\" Kent told her.\n\"Each wheel opens the valves of one of the ship's decks or compartments\nand allows its air to escape into space. They're used for testing leaks\nin the different deck and compartment divisions. Marta, you must turn\nall those wheels as far as you can to the right.\"\n\n\"But all the ship's air will rush out; the guards below have no suits\non, and they'll be--\" she was exclaiming. Kent interrupted.\n\n\"It's the only chance for you, for all of us. Turn them!\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, and Kent was going to repeat the order\nwhen her voice came, lower in tone, a little strange:\n\n\"I understand, Rance. I'm going to turn them.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThere was silence again, and Kent and the men grouped round him were\ntense. All were envisioning the same thing--the air rushing out of the\n_Pallas'_ valves, and the unsuspecting guards in its lower deck smitten\nsuddenly by an instantaneous death.\n\nThen Marta's voice, almost a sob: \"I turned them, Rance. The air puffed\nout all around me.\"\n\n\"Your space-suit is working all right?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" she said.\n\n\"Then go down and tie together as many space-helmets as you can manage,\nget out of the airlock, and try to get over here to the _Martian Queen_\nwith them. Do you think you can do that, Marta?\"\n\n\"I'm going to try,\" she said steadily. \"But I'll have to pass those men\nin the lower-deck I just--killed. Don't be anxious if I don't talk for a\nlittle.\"\n\nYet her voice came again almost immediately. \"Rance, the pumping has\nstopped! They must have pumped all the fuel into the _Pallas_!\"\n\n\"Then Jandron and the rest will be coming back to the _Pallas_ at once!\"\nKent cried. \"Hurry, Marta!\"\n\nThe suit-phone was silent; and Kent and the rest, their faces closely\npressed against the deck-windows, peered intently along the wreck-pack's\nedge. The _Pallas_ was hidden from their view by the wrecks between, and\nthere was no sign as yet of the girl.\n\nKent felt his heart beating rapidly. Crain and Liggett pressed beside\nhim, the men around them; Krell's face was a mask as he too gazed. Kent\nwas rapidly becoming convinced that some mischance had overtaken the\ngirl when an exclamation came from Liggett. He pointed excitedly.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nShe was in sight, unrecognizable in space-suit and helmet, floating\nalong the wreck-pack's edge toward them. A mass of the glassite\nspace-helmets tied together was in her grasp. She climbed bravely over\nthe stern of a projecting wreck and shot on toward the _Martian Queen_.\n\nThe airlock's door was open for her, and, when she was inside it, the\nouter door closed and air hissed into the lock. In a moment she was in\namong them, still clinging to the helmets. Kent grasped her swaying\nfigure and removed her helmet.\n\n\"Marta, you're all right?\" he cried. She nodded a little weakly.\n\n\"I'm all right. It was just that I had to go over those guards that were\nall frozen.... Terrible!\"\n\n\"Get these helmets on!\" Crain was crying. \"There's a dozen of them, and\ntwelve of us can stop Jandron's men if we get back in time!\"\n\nKent and Liggett and the nearer of their men were swiftly donning the\nhelmets. Krell grasped one and Crain sought to snatch it.\n\n\"Let that go! We'll not have you with us when we haven't enough helmets\nfor our own men!\"\n\n\"You'll have me or kill me here!\" Krell cried, his eyes hate-mad. \"I've\ngot my own account to settle with Jandron!\"\n\n\"Let him have it!\" Liggett cried. \"We've no time now to argue!\"\n\nKent reached toward the girl. \"Marta, give one of the men your helmet,\"\nhe ordered; but she shook her head.\n\n\"I'm going with you!\" Before Kent could dispute she had the helmet on\nagain, and Crain was pushing them into the airlock. The nine or ten left\ninside without helmets hastily thrust steel bars into the men's hands\nbefore the inner door closed. The outer one opened and they leapt forth\ninto space, floating smoothly along the wreck-pack's border with bars in\ntheir grasp, thirteen strong.\n\nKent found the slowness with which they floated forward torturing. He\nglimpsed Crain and Liggett ahead, Marta beside him, Krell floating\nbehind him to the left. They reached the projecting freighters, climbed\nover and around them, braced against them and shot on. They sighted the\n_Pallas_ ahead now. Suddenly they discerned another group of eleven\nfigures in space-suits approaching it from the wreck-pack's interior,\nrolling up the tube-line that led from the _Pallas_ as they did so.\nJandron's party!\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nJandron and his men had seen them and were suddenly making greater\nefforts to reach the _Pallas_. Kent and his companions, propelling\nthemselves frenziedly on from another wreck, reached the ship's side at\nthe same time as Jandron's men. The two groups mixed and mingled,\ntwisted and turned in a mad space-combat.\n\nKent had been grasped by one of Jandron's men and raised his bar to\ncrack the other's glassite helmet. His opponent caught the bar, and they\nstruggled, twisting and turning over and over far up in space amid a\nhalf-score similar struggles. Kent wrenched his bar free at last from\nthe other's grasp and brought it down on his helmet. The glassite\ncracked, and he caught a glimpse of the man's hate-distorted face frozen\ninstantly in death.\n\nKent released him and propelled himself toward a struggling trio nearby.\nAs he floated toward them, he saw Jandron beyond them making wild\ngestures of command and saw Krell approaching Jandron with upraised bar.\nKent, on reaching the three combatants, found them to be two of\nJandron's men overcoming Crain. He shattered one's helmet as he reached\nthem, but saw the other's bar go up for a blow.\n\nKent twisted frantically, uselessly, to escape it, but before the blow\ncould descend a bar shattered his opponent's helmet from behind. As the\nman froze in instant death Kent saw that it was Marta who had struck him\nfrom behind. He jerked her to his side. The struggles in space around\nthem seemed to be ending.\n\nSix of Jandron's party had been slain, and three of Kent's companions.\nJandron's four other followers were giving up the combat, floating off\ninto the wreck-pack in clumsy, hasty flight. Someone grasped Kent's arm,\nand he turned to find it was Liggett.\n\n\"They're beaten!\" Liggett's voice came to him! \"They're all killed but\nthose four!\"\n\n\"What about Jandron himself?\" Kent cried. Liggett pointed to two\nspace-suited bodies twisting together in space, with bars still in their\nlifeless grasp.\n\nKent saw through their shattered helmets the stiffened faces of Jandron\nand Krell, their helmets having apparently been broken by each other's\nsimultaneous blows.\n\nCrain had gripped Kent's arm also. \"Kent, it's over!\" he was exclaiming.\n\"Liggett and I will close the _Pallas'_ exhaust-valves and release new\nair in it. You take over helmets for the rest of our men in the _Martian\nQueen_.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nIn several minutes Kent was back with the men from the _Martian Queen_.\nThe _Pallas_ was ready, with Liggett in its pilot-house, the men taking\ntheir stations, and Crain and Marta awaiting Kent.\n\n\"We've enough fuel to take us out of the dead-area and to Neptune\nwithout trouble!\" Crain declared. \"But what about those four of\nJandron's men that got away?\"\n\n\"The best we can do is leave them here,\" Kent told him. \"Best for them,\ntoo, for at Neptune they'd be executed, while they can live indefinitely\nin the wreck-pack.\"\n\n\"I've seen so many men killed on the _Martian Queen_ and here,\" pleaded\nMarta. \"Please don't take them to Neptune.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll leave them,\" Crain agreed, \"though the scoundrels\nought to meet justice.\" He hastened up to the pilot-house after Liggett.\n\nIn a moment came the familiar blast of the rocket-tubes, and the\n_Pallas_ shot out cleanly from the wreck-pack's edge. A scattered cheer\ncame from the crew. With gathering speed the ship arrowed out, its\nrocket-tubes blasting now in steady succession.\n\nKent, with his arm across Marta's shoulders, watched the wreck-pack grow\nsmaller behind. It lay as when he first had seen it, a strange great\nmass, floating forever motionless among the brilliant stars. He felt the\ngirl beside him shiver, and swung her quickly around.\n\n\"Let's not look back or remember now, Marta!\" he said. \"Let's look\nahead.\"\n\nShe nestled closer inside his arm. \"Yes, Rance. Let's look ahead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Sargasso of Space, by Edmond Hamilton"}

They invariably meet on the stairs of the lodging-house when one comes in from work as the other is going out, but neither has any idea that Mrs Bouncer is letting his room to the other. Cox, suspicious that Mrs Bouncer has been using his flat during the day, complains to her that his coal keeps disappearing and there is \"a steady increase of evaporation among my candles, wood, sugar and lucifer matches.\" He also complains that his room is continually full of tobacco smoke. Mrs Bouncer gives various excuses – among others, that Box, who, she says, occupies the attic, is a persistent smoker, and that his smoke must come down the chimney. Cox departs for his work at the hat shop, and on the stairs passes Box who is returning from the night shift at the newspaper.\nBox has brought home with him a rasher of bacon, which he at once prepares to cook. He lights the fire, is indignant that his matches have been used and his candles burnt low; for, being at home only during the day, he suspects Mrs Bouncer of these depredations. Leaving his bacon to cook, he retires to bed for a short nap. Cox then returns, having been given the day off by his employer. He has bought a mutton chop and, going to cook it on the gridiron, finds the fire already lit and the rasher of bacon on the gridiron. He removes it, puts his chop in its stead, and hurries into an adjoining room for a plate. The slamming of the door awakens Box, who, recollecting his bacon, leaps from the bed, and finds the chop where he had left the rasher. He angrily seizes the chop, flings it from the window, and leaves the room to fetch a plate. Cox re-enters, and, in lieu of his chop, discovers the rasher, which follows the chop out of the window. Box and Cox meet, each imagining the other to be an intruder, each pulling from his pocket the last week's receipt for rent, and each clamouring loudly for redress from the landlady. Mrs Bouncer is forced to explain the mystery, and she throws herself on the kindness of Box and Cox by promising either of them a handsome second floor back room, which she hurries off to prepare.\nFrustrated, Box asks, \"Hark ye, sir – can you fight?\" Cox answers, \"No, sir.\" Box: \"No? Then come on!\" Agreeing, however, that they have no quarrel with each other, and that the whole mess is Mrs Bouncer's fault, Box and Cox converse civilly. It emerges that Cox is about to be married to a widow, Penelope Anne Wiggins, a prosperous proprietress of bathing machines at Margate and Ramsgate. Box is astonished, as he too had once been engaged to Mrs Wiggins, but, he reveals, he had struck on an ingenious plan to escape her clutches: he had pretended to commit suicide by drowning. Cox is equally reluctant to marry her. The two argue about which of them is obliged to do so, and eventually they call for pistols. When Mrs Bouncer goes to bring them, Cox cries, \"Stop! You don't mean to say ... that you keep loaded fire-arms in the house?\" \"Oh, no\", says Mrs Bouncer, \"they're not loaded\". Cox: \"Then produce the murderous weapons instantly!\" Meanwhile, the two agree to cast dice; the loser must marry Penelope Anne. Both have loaded dice, and at each successive throw they continue to throw sixes. The dice are then changed for shillings. At every toss each man's coin lands on heads, as both contestants are using double-headed coins.\nThe impasse is broken when a letter arrives from Margate stating that Penelope Anne has drowned in a boating accident, and has left her property to her intended husband. Box and Cox now argue their claims to the bathing machines, but finally they agree to split the fortune. Now a second letter arrives, which states that Penelope Anne is quite safe and is on the road to London to claim her lover. Escape is now hopeless, and Box and Cox are in despair. A vehicle arrives, a knock resounds at the door, and Box and Cox place their backs to the door. Penelope Anne goes away again, leaving another letter revealing that she has decided to marry Mr Knox, an admirer nearer her own age. Box and Cox are delighted, and their happiness is completed by the realisation that they are brothers, who have been long separated (Box: \"Have you such a thing as a strawberry mark on your left arm?\" Cox: \"No!\" Box: \"Then it is he!\"). They reject the second-floor back room and determine to reside permanently in the same room, and under the tenancy of the same landlady.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK BOX AND COX ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Paul Haxo from page images generously made\navailable by the Internet Archive and the Library of\nCongress.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MINOR DRAMA.\nNo. XXI.\n\nBOX AND COX.\n\n_A Romance of Real Life_\nIN ONE ACT.\n\nBY JOHN MADDISON MORTON, ESQ.\n\nWITH THE STAGE BUSINESS, CAST OF CHARACTERS, COSTUMES, RELATIVE\nPOSITIONS, &c.\n\nNEW YORK:\nDOUGLAS, NO. 11 SPRUCE ST\nAND FOR SALE BY ALL BOOKSELLERS.\n1848.\n\n\n\nCAST OF CHARACTERS.\n\n                             Theatre,\n                              London,        Olympic,      Palmo's,\n                               1847.           1848.        1848.\nJohn Box,                Mr. Buckstone.

I've half a mind to register an oath that I'll never have my hair\ncut again! [_His hair is very short._] I look as if I had just been\ncropped for the militia! And I was particularly emphatic in my\ninstructions to the hair-dresser, only to cut the ends off. He must\nhave thought I meant the other ends! Never mind--I shan't meet anybody\nto care about so early. Eight o'clock, I declare! I haven't a moment\nto lose. Fate has placed me with the most punctual, particular, and\nperemptory of hatters, and I must fulfil my destiny. [_Knock at L.\nD._] Open locks, whoever knocks!\n\n_Enter MRS. BOUNCER, L._\n\nMRS. B. Good-morning, Mr. Cox. I hope you slept comfortably, Mr. Cox?\n\nCOX. I can't say I did, Mrs. B. I should feel obliged to you, if you\ncould accommodate me with a more protuberant bolster, Mrs. B. The one\nI've got now seems to me to have about a handful and a half of\nfeathers at each end, and nothing whatever in the middle.\n\nMRS. B. Anything to accommodate you, Mr. Cox.\n\nCOX. Thank you. Then, perhaps, you'll be good enough to hold this\nglass, while I finish my toilet.\n\nMRS. B. Certainly. [_Holding glass before COX, who ties his cravat._]\nWhy, I do declare, you've had your hair cut.\n\nCOX. Cut? It strikes me I've had it mowed! It's very kind of you to\nmention it, but I'm sufficiently conscious of the absurdity of my\npersonal appearance already. [_Puts on his coat._] Now for my hat.\n[_Puts on his hat, which comes over his eyes._] That's the effect of\nhaving one's hair cut. This hat fitted me quite tight before. Luckily\nI've got two or three more. [_Goes in at L., and returns, with three\nhats of different shapes, and puts them on, one after the other--all\nof which are too big for him._] This is pleasant! Never mind. This one\nappears to me to wabble about rather less than the others--[_Puts on\nhat,_]--and now I'm off! By the bye, Mrs. Bouncer, I wish to call your\nattention to a fact that has been evident to me for some time\npast--and that is, that my coals go remarkably fast--\n\nMRS. B. Lor, Mr. Cox!\n\nCOX. It is not the case only with the coals, Mrs. Bouncer, but I've\nlately observed a gradual and steady increase of evaporation among my\ncandles, wood, sugar, and lucifer matches.\n\nMRS. B. Lor, Mr. Cox! you surely don't suspect me?\n\nCOX. I don't say I do, Mrs. B.; only I wish you distinctly to\nunderstand, that I don't believe it's the cat.\n\nMRS. B. Is there anything else you've got to grumble about, sir?\n\nCOX. Grumble! Mrs. Bouncer, do you possess such a thing as a\ndictionary?\n\nMRS. B. No, sir.\n\nCOX. Then I'll lend you one--and if you turn to the letter G, you'll\nfind \"Grumble, verb neuter--to complain without a cause.\" Now that's\nnot my case, Mrs. B., and now that we are upon the subject, I wish to\nknow how it is that I frequently find my apartment full of smoke?\n\nMRS. B. Why--I suppose the chimney--\n\nCOX. The chimney doesn't smoke tobacco. I'm speaking of tobacco smoke,\nMrs. B. I hope, Mrs. Bouncer, _you're_ not guilty of cheroots or\nCubas?\n\nMRS. B. Not I, indeed, Mr. Cox.\n\nCOX. Nor partial to a pipe?\n\nMRS. B. No, sir.\n\nCOX. Then, how is it that--\n\nMRS. B. Why--I suppose--yes--that must be it--\n\nCOX. At present I am entirely of your opinion--because I haven't the\nmost distant particle of an idea what you mean.\n\nMRS. B. Why the gentleman who has got the attics, is hardly ever\nwithout a pipe in his mouth--and there he sits, with his feet upon the\nmantel-piece--\n\nCOX. The mantel piece! That strikes me as being a considerable\nstretch, either of your imagination, Mrs. B., or the gentleman's legs.\nI presume you mean the fender or the hob.\n\nMRS. B. Sometimes one, sometimes t'other. Well, there he sits for\nhours, and puffs away into the fire-place.\n\nCOX. Ah, then you mean to say that this gentleman's smoke, instead of\nemulating the example of all other sorts of smoke, and going _up_ the\nchimney, thinks proper to affect a singularity by taking the contrary\ndirection?\n\nMRS. B. Why--\n\nCOX. Then, I suppose, the gentleman you are speaking of, is the same\nindividual that I invariably meet coming up stairs when I'm going\ndown, and going down stairs when I'm coming up!\n\nMRS. B. Why--yes--I--\n\nCOX. From the appearance of his outward man, I should unhesitatingly\nset him down as a gentleman connected with the printing interest.\n\nMRS. B. Yes, sir--and a very respectable young gentleman he is.\n\nCOX. Well, good-morning, Mrs. Bouncer!\n\nMRS. B. You'll be back at your usual time, I suppose, sir?\n\nCOX. Yes--nine o'clock. You needn't light my fire in future, Mrs.\nB.--I'll do it myself. Don't forget the bolster! [_Going, stops._] A\nhalfpenny worth of milk, Mrs. Bouncer--and be good enough to let it\nstand--I wish the cream to accumulate.\n\n[_Exit at L. C._\n\nMRS. B. He's gone at last! I declare I was all in a tremble for fear\nMr. Box would come in before Mr. Cox went out. Luckily, they've never\nmet yet--and what's more, they're not very likely to do so; for Mr.\nBox is hard at work at a newspaper office all night, and doesn't come\nhome till the morning, and Mr. Cox is busy making hats all day long,\nand doesn't come home till night; so that I'm getting double rent for\nmy room, and neither of my lodgers are any the wiser for it. It was a\ncapital idea of mine--that it was! But I haven't an instant to lose.\nFirst of all, let me put Mr. Cox's things out of Mr. Box's way. [_She\ntakes the three hats, COX'S dressing gown and slippers, opens door at\nL. and puts them in, then shuts door and locks it._] Now, then, to put\nthe key where Mr. Cox always finds it. [_Puts the key on the ledge of\nthe door, L._] I really must beg Mr. Box not to smoke so much. I was\nso dreadfully puzzled to know what to say when Mr. Cox spoke about it.\nNow, then, to make the bed--and don't let me forget that what's the\nhead of the bed for Mr. Cox, becomes the foot of the bed for Mr.\nBox--people's tastes do differ so. [_Goes behind the curtains of the\nbed, and seems to be making it--then appears with a very thin bolster\nin her hand._] The idea of Mr. Cox presuming to complain of such a\nbolster as this! [_She disappears again, behind curtains._]\n\nBOX. [_Without._] Pooh--pooh! Why don't you keep your own side of the\nstaircase, sir? [_Enters at back, dressed as a Printer. Puts his head\nout at door again, shouting._] It was as much your fault as mine, sir!\nI say, sir--it was as much your fault as mine, sir!\n\nMRS. B. [_Emerging from behind the curtains of bed._] Lor, Mr. Box!\nwhat is the matter?\n\nBOX. Mind your own business, Bouncer!\n\nMRS. B. Dear, dear, Mr. Box! what a temper you are in, to be sure! I\ndeclare you're quite pale in the face!\n\nBOX. What colour would you have a man be, who has been setting up long\nleaders for a daily paper all night?\n\nMRS. B. But, then, you've all the day to yourself.\n\nBOX. [_Looking significantly at MRS. BOUNCER._] So it seems! Far be it\nfrom me, Bouncer, to hurry your movements, but I think it right to\nacquaint you with my immediate intention of divesting myself of my\ngarments, and going to bed.\n\nMRS. B. Oh, Mr. Box!\n\n[_Going._\n\nBOX. Stop! Can you inform me who the individual is that I invariably\nencounter going down stairs when I'm coming up, and coming up stairs\nwhen I'm going down?\n\nMRS. B. [_Confused._] Oh--yes--the gentleman in the attic, sir.\n\nBOX. Oh! There's nothing particularly remarkable about him, except his\nhats. I meet him in all sorts of hats--white hats and black hats--hats\nwith broad brims, and hats with narrow brims--hats with naps, and hats\nwithout naps--in short, I have come to the conclusion, that he must be\nindividually and professionally associated with the hatting interest.\n\nMRS. B. Yes, sir. And, by the bye, Mr. Box, he begged me to request of\nyou, as a particular favor, that you would not smoke quite so much.\n\nBOX. Did he? Then you may tell the gentle hatter, with my compliments,\nthat if he objects to the effluvia of tobacco, he had better\ndomesticate himself in some adjoining parish.\n\nMRS. B. Oh, Mr. Box! You surely wouldn't deprive me of a lodger?\n\n[_Pathetically._\n\nBOX. It would come to precisely the same thing, Bouncer, because if I\ndetect the slightest attempt to put my pipe out, I at once give you\nwarning that I shall give you warning at once.\n\nMRS. B. Well, Mr. Box--do you want anything more of me?\n\nBOX. On the contrary--I've had quite enough of you!\n\nMRS. B. Well, if ever! What next, I wonder?\n\n[_Goes out at L. C., slamming door after her._\n\nBOX. It's quite extraordinary, the trouble I always have to get rid of\nthat venerable female! She knows I'm up all night, and yet she seems\nto set her face against my indulging in a horizontal position by day.\nNow, let me see--shall I take my nap before I swallow my breakfast, or\nshall I take my breakfast before I swallow my nap--I mean, shall I\nswallow my nap before--no--never mind! I've got a rasher of bacon\nsomewhere--[_Feeling in his pockets_]--I've the most distinct and\nvivid recollection of having purchased a rasher of bacon--Oh, here it\nis--[_Produces it, wrapped in paper, and places it on table._]--and a\npenny roll. The next thing is to light the fire. Where are my\nlucifers? [_Looking on mantel-piece R., and taking box, opens it._]\nNow, 'pon my life, this is too bad of Bouncer--this is, by several\ndegrees, too bad! I had a whole box full, three days ago, and now\nthere's only one! I'm perfectly aware that she purloins my coals and\nmy candles, and my sugar--but I did think--oh, yes, I did think that\nmy lucifers would be sacred! [_Takes candlestick off the mantel-piece,\nR., in which there is a very small end of candle--looks at it._] Now I\nshould like to ask any unprejudiced person or persons their opinion\ntouching this candle. In the first place, a candle is an article that\nI don't require, because I'm only at home in the day time--and I\nbought this candle on the first of May--Chimney-sweepers'\nDay--calculating that it would last me three months, and here's one\nweek not half over, and the candle three parts gone! [_Lights the\nfire--then takes down a gridiron, which is hanging over the fireplace,\nR._] Mrs. Bouncer has been using my gridiron! The last article of\nconsumption that I cooked upon it was a pork chop, and now it is\npowerfully impregnated with the odour of red herrings! [_Places\ngridiron on fire, and then, with a fork, lays rasher of bacon on the\ngridiron._] How sleepy I am, to be sure! I'd indulge myself with a\nnap, if there was anybody here to superintend the turning of my bacon.\n[_Yawning again._] Perhaps it will turn itself. I must lie down--so,\nhere goes. [_Lies on the bed, closing the curtains round him--after a\nshort pause--_\n\n_Enter COX, hurriedly, L. C._\n\nCOX. Well, wonders will never cease! Conscious of being eleven minutes\nand a half behind time, I was sneaking into the shop, in a state of\nconsiderable excitement, when my venerable employer, with a smile of\nextreme benevolence on his aged countenance, said to me--\"Cox, I\nshan't want you to-day--you can have a holiday.\"--Thoughts of\n\"Gravesend and back--fare, One Shilling,\" instantly suggested\nthemselves, intermingled with visions of \"Greenwich for Fourpence!\"\nThen came the Twopenny Omnibuses, and the Halfpenny boats--in short,\nI'm quite bewildered! However, I must have my breakfast first--that'll\ngive me time to reflect. I've bought a mutton chop, so I shan't want\nany dinner. [_Puts chop on table._] Good gracious! I've forgot the\nbread. Holloa! what's this? A roll, I declare! Come, that's lucky!\nNow, then, to light the fire. Holloa--[_Seeing the lucifer-box on\ntable,_]--who presumes to touch my box of lucifers? Why, it's empty! I\nleft one in it--I'll take my oath I did. Heydey! why, the fire _is_\nlighted! Where's the gridiron? _On_ the fire, I declare! And what's\nthat on it? Bacon? Bacon it is! Well, now, 'pon my life, there is a\nquiet coolness about Mrs. Bouncer's proceedings that's almost amusing.\nShe takes my last lucifer--my coals, and my gridiron, to cook her\nbreakfast by! No, no--I can't stand this! Come out of that! [_Pokes\nfork into bacon, and puts it on a plate on the table, then places his\nchop on the gridiron, which he puts on the fire._] Now, then, for my\nbreakfast things. [_Taking key, hung up, L., opens door L. and goes\nout, slamming the door after him, with a loud noise._\n\nBOX. [_Suddenly showing his head from behind the curtains._] Come in!\nif it's you, Mrs. Bouncer--you needn't be afraid. I wonder how long\nI've been asleep? [_Suddenly recollecting._] Goodness gracious--my\nbacon! [_Leaps off bed, and runs to the fireplace._] Holloa! what's\nthis? A chop! Whose chop? Mrs. Bouncer's, I'll be bound.--She thought\nto cook her breakfast while I was asleep--with _my_ coals, too--and my\ngridiron! Ha, ha! But where's my bacon? [_Seeing it on table._] Here\nit is. Well, 'pon my life, Bouncer's going it! And shall I curb my\nindignation? Shall I falter in my vengeance? No! [_Digs the fork into\nthe chop, opens window, and throws chop out--shuts window again._] So\nmuch for Bouncer's breakfast, and now for my own! [_With the fork he\nputs the bacon on the gridiron again._] I may as well lay my breakfast\nthings.--[_Goes to mantel-piece at R., takes key out of one of the\nornaments, opens door at R. and exit, slamming door after him._\n\nCOX. [_Putting his head in quickly at L._] Come in--come in! [_Opens\ndoor, L. C. Enters with a small tray, on which are tea things, &c.,\nwhich he places on drawers, L. and suddenly recollects._] Oh,\ngoodness! my chop! [_Running to fireplace._] Holloa--what's that? The\nbacon again! Oh, pooh! Zounds--confound it--dash it--damn it--I can't\nstand this! [_Pokes fork into bacon, opens window, and flings it out,\nshuts window again, returns to drawers for tea things, and encounters\nBOX coming from his cupboard with his tea things--they walk down C. of\nstage together._] Who are you, sir?\n\nBOX. If you come to that--who are _you?_\n\nCOX. What do you want here, sir?\n\nBOX. If you come to that--what do _you_ want?\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] It's the printer! [_Puts tea-things on the drawers._\n\nBOX. [_Aside._] It's the hatter! [_Puts tea-things on table._\n\nCOX. Go to your attic, sir--\n\nBOX. _My_ attic, sir? _Your_ attic, sir!\n\nCOX. Printer, I shall do you a frightful injury, if you don't\ninstantly leave my apartment.\n\nBOX. _Your_ apartment? You mean _my_ apartment, you contemptible\nhatter, you!\n\nCOX. _Your_ apartment? Ha! ha!--come, I like that! Look here,\nsir--[_Produces a paper out of his pocket._] Mrs. Bouncer's receipt\nfor the last week's rent, sir--\n\nBOX. [_Produces a paper, and holds it close to COX'S face._] Ditto,\nsir!\n\nCOX. [_Suddenly shouting._] Thieves!\n\nBOX. Murder!\n\nBOTH. Mrs. Bouncer! [_Each runs to door, L. C., calling._\n\n_MRS. BOUNCER runs in at door, L. C._\n\nMRS. B. What is the matter? [_COX and BOX seize MRS. BOUNCER by the\narm, and drag her forward._\n\nBOX. Instantly remove that hatter!\n\nCOX. Immediately turn out that printer!\n\nMRS. B. Well--but, gentlemen--\n\nCOX. Explain!\n\n[_Pulling her round to him._\n\nBOX. Explain! [_Pulling her round to him._] Whose room is this?\n\nCOX. Yes, woman--whose room is this?\n\nBOX. Doesn't it belong to me?\n\nMRS. B. No!\n\nCOX. There! You hear, sir--it belongs to me!\n\nMRS. B. No--it belongs to both of you!\n\n[_Sobbing._\n\nCOX & BOX. Both of us?\n\nMRS. B. Oh, dear gentlemen, don't be angry--but, you see, this\ngentleman--[_Pointing to BOX,_]--only being at home in the daytime,\nand that gentleman--[_Pointing to COX,_]--at night, I thought I might\nventure, until my little back second floor room was ready--\n\nCOX & BOX. [_Eagerly._] When will your little back second floor room\nbe ready?\n\nMRS. B. Why, to-morrow--\n\nCOX. I'll take it!\n\nBOX. So will I!\n\nMRS. B. Excuse me--but if you both take it, you may just as well stop\nwhere you are.\n\nCOX & BOX. True.\n\nCOX. I spoke first, sir--\n\nBOX. With all my heart, sir. The little back second floor room is\nyours, sir--now, go--\n\nCOX. Go? Pooh--pooh!\n\nMRS. B. Now don't quarrel, gentlemen. You see, there used to be a\npartition here--\n\nCOX & BOX. Then put it up!\n\nMRS. B. Nay, I'll see if I can't get the other room ready this very\nday. Now _do_ keep your tempers.\n\n[_Exit, L._\n\nCOX. What a disgusting position!\n\n[_Walking rapidly round stage._\n\nBOX. [_Sitting down on chair, at one side of table, and following\nCOX'S movements._] Will you allow me to observe, if you have not had\nany exercise to-day, you'd better go out and take it.\n\nCOX. I shall not do anything of the sort, sir.\n\n[_Seating himself at the table opposite BOX._\n\nBOX. Very well, sir.\n\nCOX. Very well, sir! However, don't let me prevent _you_ from going\nout.\n\nBOX. Don't flatter yourself, sir. [_COX is about to break a piece of\nthe roll off._] Holloa! that's my roll, sir-- [_Snatches it away--puts\na pipe in his mouth, lights it with a piece of tinder--and puffs smoke\nacross to COX._\n\nCOX. Holloa! What are you about, sir?\n\nBOX. What am I about? I'm about to smoke.\n\nCOX. Wheugh!\n\n[_Goes and opens window at BOX'S back._\n\nBOX. Holloa! [_Turns round._] Put down that window, sir!\n\nCOX. Then put your pipe out, sir!\n\nBOX. There!\n\n[_Puts pipe on table._\n\nCOX. There!\n\n[_Slams down window and re-seats himself._\n\nBOX. I shall retire to my pillow. [_Goes up, takes off his jacket,\nthen goes towards bed, and sits down upon it, L. C._\n\nCOX. [_Jumps up, goes to bed, and sits down on R. of BOX._] I beg your\npardon, sir--I cannot allow any one to rumple my bed. [_Both rising._]\n\nBOX. _Your_ bed? Hark ye, sir--can you fight?\n\nCOX. No, sir.\n\nBOX. No? Then come on--\n\n[_Sparring at COX._\n\nCOX. Sit down, sir--or I'll instantly vociferate \"Police!\"\n\nBOX. [_Seats himself--COX does the same._] I say, sir----\n\nCOX. Well, sir?\n\nBOX. Although we are doomed to occupy the same room for a few hours\nlonger, I don't see any necessity for our cutting each other's\nthroats, sir.\n\nCOX. Not at all. It's an operation that I should decidedly object to.\n\nBOX. And, after all, I've no violent animosity to you, sir.\n\nCOX. Nor have I any rooted antipathy to you, sir.\n\nBOX. Besides, it was all Mrs. Bouncer's fault, sir.\n\nCOX. Entirely, sir. [_Gradually approaching chairs._]\n\nBOX. Very well, sir!\n\nCOX. Very well, sir! [_Pause._]\n\nBOX. Take a bit of roll, sir?\n\nCOX. Thank ye, sir. [_Breaking a bit off. Pause._]\n\nBOX. Do you sing, sir?\n\nCOX. I sometimes join in a chorus.\n\nBOX. Then give us a chorus. [_Pause._] Have you seen the Bosjemans,\nsir?\n\nCOX. No, sir--my wife wouldn't let me.\n\nBOX. Your _wife!_\n\nCOX. That is--my _intended_ wife.\n\nBOX. Well, that's the same thing! I congratulate you! [_Shaking\nhands._]\n\nCOX. [_With a deep sigh._] Thank ye. [_Seeing BOX about to get up._]\nYou needn't disturb yourself, sir. She won't come here.\n\nBOX. Oh! I understand. You've got a snug little establishment of your\nown _here_--on the sly--cunning dog--[_Nudging COX._]\n\nCOX. [_Drawing himself up._] No such thing, sir--I repeat, sir--no\nsuch thing, sir, but my wife--I mean, my _intended_ wife--happens to\nbe the proprietor of a considerable number of bathing-machines----\n\nBOX. [_Suddenly._] Ha! Where? [_Grasping COX'S arm._]\n\nCOX. At a favorite watering-place. How curious you are!\n\nBOX. Not at all. Well?\n\nCOX. Consequently, in the bathing season--which luckily is rather a\nlong one--we see but little of each other; but as that is now over, I\nam daily indulging in the expectation of being blessed with the sight\nof _my_ beloved. [_Very seriously._] Are _you_ married?\n\nBOX. Me? Why--not exactly!\n\nCOX. Ah--a happy bachelor!\n\nBOX. Why--not--precisely!\n\nCOX. Oh! a--widower?\n\nBOX. No--not absolutely!\n\nCOX. You'll excuse me, sir--but at present I don't exactly understand\nhow you can help being one of the three.\n\nBOX. Not help it?\n\nCOX. No, sir--not you, nor any other man alive!\n\nBOX. Ah, that may be--but I'm not alive!\n\nCOX. [_Pushing back his chair._] You'll excuse me, sir--but I don't\nlike joking upon such subjects.\n\nBOX. I'm perfectly serious, sir. I've been defunct for the last three\nyears!\n\nCOX. [_Shouting._] Will you be quiet, sir?\n\nBOX. If you won't believe me, I'll refer you to a very large,\nnumerous, and respectable circle of disconsolate friends.\n\nCOX. My dear sir--my _very_ dear sir--if there does exist any\ningenious contrivance whereby a man on the eve of committing matrimony\ncan leave this world, and yet stop in it, I shouldn't be sorry to know\nit.\n\nBOX. Oh! then I presume I'm not to set you down as being frantically\nattached to your intended?\n\nCOX. Why, not exactly; and yet, at present, I'm only aware of one\nobstacle to my doating upon her, and that is, that I can't abide her!\n\nBOX. Then there's nothing more easy. Do as I did.\n\nCOX. [_Eagerly._] I will! What was it?\n\nBOX. Drown yourself!\n\nCOX. [_Shouting again._] Will you be quiet, sir?\n\nBOX. Listen to me. Three years ago it was my misfortune to captivate\nthe affections of a still blooming, though somewhat middle-aged widow,\nat Ramsgate.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] Singular enough! Just my case three months ago at\nMargate.\n\nBOX. Well, sir, to escape her importunities, I came to the\ndetermination of enlisting into the Blues, or Life Guards.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] So did I. How very odd!\n\nBOX. But they wouldn't have me--they actually had the effrontery to\nsay that I was too short--\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] And I wasn't tall enough!\n\nBOX. So I was obliged to content myself with a marching regiment--I\nenlisted!\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] So did I. Singular coincidence!\n\nBOX. I'd no sooner done so, than I was sorry for it.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] So was I.\n\nBOX. My infatuated widow offered to purchase my discharge, on\ncondition that I'd lead her to the altar.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] Just my case!\n\nBOX. I hesitated--at last I consented.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] I consented at once!\n\nBOX. Well, sir--the day fixed for the happy ceremony at length drew\nnear--in fact, too near to be pleasant--so I suddenly discovered that\nI wasn't worthy to possess her, and I told her so--when, instead of\nbeing flattered by the compliment, she flew upon me like a tiger of\nthe female gender--I rejoined--when suddenly something whizzed past\nme, within an inch of my ear, and shivered into a thousand fragments\nagainst the mantel-piece--it was the slop-basin. I retaliated with a\ntea-cup--we parted, and the next morning I was served with a notice of\naction for breach of promise.\n\nCOX. Well, sir?\n\nBOX. Well, sir--ruin stared me in the face--the action proceeded\nagainst me with gigantic strides--I took a desperate resolution--I\nleft my home early one morning, with one suit of clothes on my back,\nand another tied up in a bundle, under my arm--I arrived on the\ncliffs--opened my bundle--deposited the suit of clothes on the very\nverge of the precipice--took one look down into the yawning gulph\nbeneath me, and walked off in the opposite direction.\n\nCOX. Dear me! I think I begin to have some slight perception of your\nmeaning. Ingenious creature! You disappeared--the suit of clothes were\nfound--\n\nBOX. Exactly--and in one of the pockets of the coat, or the waistcoat,\nor the pantaloons--I forget which--there was also found a piece of\npaper, with these affecting farewell words: \"This is thy work, oh,\nPenelope Ann!\"\n\nCOX. Penelope Ann! [_Starts up, takes BOX by the arm, and leads him\nslowly to front of stage._] Penelope Ann?\n\nBOX. Penelope Ann!\n\nCOX. Originally widow of William Wiggins?\n\nBOX. Widow of William Wiggins!\n\nCOX. Proprietor of bathing machines?\n\nBOX. Proprietor of bathing machines!\n\nCOX. At Margate?\n\nBOX. And Ramsgate!\n\nCOX. It must be she! And you, sir--you are Box--the lamented, long\nlost Box!\n\nBOX. I am!\n\nCOX. And I was about to marry the interesting creature you so cruelly\ndeceived.\n\nBOX. Ha! then you are Cox?\n\nCOX. I am!\n\nBOX. I heard of it. I congratulate you--I give you joy! And now, I\nthink I'll go and take a stroll.\n\n[_Going._\n\nCOX. No you don't! [_Stopping him._] I'll not lose sight of you till\nI've restored you to the arms of your intended.\n\nBOX. _My_ intended? You mean _your_ intended.\n\nCOX. No, sir--yours!\n\nBOX. How can she be _my_ intended, now that I'm drowned?\n\nCOX. You're no such thing, sir! and I prefer presenting you to\nPenelope Ann.\n\nBOX. I've no wish to be introduced to your intended.\n\nCOX. _My_ intended? How can that be, sir? You proposed to her first!\n\nBOX. What of that, sir? I came to an untimely end, and you popped the\nquestion afterwards.\n\nCOX. Very well, sir!\n\nBOX. Very well, sir!\n\nCOX. You are much more worthy of her than I am, sir. Permit me, then,\nto follow the generous impulse of my nature--I give her up to you.\n\nBOX. Benevolent being! I wouldn't rob you for the world! [_Going._]\nGood morning, sir!\n\nCOX. [_Seizing him._] Stop!\n\nBOX. Unhand me, hatter! or I shall cast off the lamb and assume the\nlion!\n\nCOX. Pooh!\n\n[_Snapping his fingers close to BOX'S face._\n\nBOX. An insult! to my very face--under my very nose! [_Rubbing it._]\nYou know the consequences, sir--instant satisfaction, sir!\n\nCOX. With all my heart, sir!\n\n[_They go to the fire-place, R., and begin ringing bells violently,\nand pull down bell-pulls._\n\nBOTH. Mrs. Bouncer! Mrs. Bouncer!\n\n_MRS. BOUNCER runs in, L. C._\n\nMRS. B. What is it, gentlemen?\n\nBOX. Pistols for two!\n\nMRS. B. Yes, sir\n\n[_Going._\n\nCOX. Stop! You don't mean to say, thoughtless and imprudent woman,\nthat you keep loaded fire-arms in the house?\n\nMRS. B. Oh no--they're not loaded.\n\nCOX. Then produce the murderous weapons instantly!\n\n[_Exit MRS. BOUNCER, L. C._\n\nBOX. I say, sir!\n\nCOX. Well, sir?\n\nBOX. What's your opinion of duelling, sir?\n\nCOX. I think it's a barbarous practice, sir.\n\nBOX. So do I, sir. To be sure, I don't so much object to it when the\npistols are not loaded.\n\nCOX. No: I dare say that _does_ make some difference.\n\nBOX. And yet, sir--on the other hand--doesn't it strike you as rather\na waste of time, for two people to keep firing pistols at one another,\nwith nothing in 'em?\n\nCOX. No, sir--not more than any other harmless recreation.\n\nBOX. Hark ye! Why do you object to marry Penelope Ann?\n\nCOX. Because, as I've observed already, I can't abide her. You'll be\nvery happy with her.\n\nBOX. Happy! Me! With the consciousness that I have deprived _you_ of\nsuch a treasure? No, no, Cox!\n\nCOX. Don't think of me, Box--I shall be sufficiently rewarded by the\nknowledge of my Box's happiness.\n\nBOX. Don't be absurd, sir!\n\nCOX. Then don't you be ridiculous, sir!\n\nBOX. I won't have her!\n\nCOX. I won't have her!\n\nBOX. I have it! Suppose we draw lots for the lady--eh, Mr. Cox?\n\nCOX. That's fair enough, Mr. Box.\n\nBOX. Or, what say you to dice?\n\nCOX. With all my heart! Dice, by all means--[_Eagerly._]\n\nBOX. [_Aside._] That's lucky! Mrs. Bouncer's nephew left a pair here\nyesterday. He sometimes persuades me to have a throw for a trifle, and\nas he always throws sixes, I suspect they are good ones.\n\n[_Goes to the cupboard at R., and brings out the dice-box._\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] I've no objection at all to dice. I lost one pound,\nseventeen and sixpence, at last Barnet Races, to a very gentlemanly\nlooking man, who had a most peculiar knack of throwing sixes; I\nsuspected they were loaded, so I gave him another half-crown, and he\ngave me the dice.\n\n[_Takes dice out of his pocket--uses lucifer box as substitute for\ndice-box, which is on table._\n\nBOX. Now then, sir!\n\nCOX. I'm ready, sir! [_They seat themselves at opposite sides of the\ntable._] Will you lead off, sir?\n\nBOX. As you please, sir. The lowest throw, of course, wins Penelope\nAnn?\n\nCOX. Of course, sir.\n\nBOX. Very well, sir!\n\nCOX. Very well, sir!\n\nBOX. [_Rattling dice and throwing._] Sixes!\n\nCOX. That's not a bad throw of yours, sir. [_Rattling dice--throws._]\nSixes!\n\nBOX. That's a pretty good one of your's, sir. [_Throws._] Sixes!\n\nCOX. [_Throws._] Sixes!\n\nBOX. Sixes!\n\nCOX.

No, _yours!_ However, it's perfectly immaterial--but she\nunquestionably was yours.\n\nCOX. How can that be? You proposed to her first!\n\nBOX. Yes, but then you--now don't let us begin again--Go on.\n\nCOX. [_Resuming letter._] \"Poor Mrs. Wiggins went out for a short\nexcursion in a sailing boat--a sudden and violent squall soon after\ntook place, which, it is supposed, upset her, as she was found, two\ndays afterwards, keel upwards.\"\n\nBOX.

{"doc_id": "e7598e595c6dd58166b88f92a5723e63f3d93b78", "token_count": 13850, "summary": " The play adapts the story of ChitrÄngadÄ and Arjuna from the Mahabarata and begins with Chitra beginning a conversation with Madana, the god of love, and Vasanta, the god of springtime and eternal youth. They ask Chitra who she is and what is bothering her, to which she replies that she is the daughter of the king of Manipur and has been raised like a boy as her father had no male heir. She is a great warrior and hero despite being born as a woman, but has never had the chance to truly live as a woman or learn how to use \"feminine wiles\". Chitra explains that she had met the warrior hero Arjuna after seeing him in the forest while she was hunting for game. Despite knowing that he had pledged several vows including one for twelve years of celibacy, Chitra fell instantly in love with him. The following day she tried to approach him and plead her case, but Arjuna turned her away due to his vows. Chitra begs with the two gods to give her a day of perfect beauty so she can win over Arjuna and have just one night of love with him. Moved by her pleas, the two gods give her not just one day but an entire year to spend with Arjuna.\nThe next scene opens with Arjuna marveling over the perfect beauty he has seen. Chitra, the beauty of which he mentions, enters and Arjuna immediately strikes up a conversation with her. He requests to know what she is searching for, to which Chitra coyly replies that she is seeking the man of her desires. The two go back and forth until Chitra admits that she is looking for him, which prompts Arjuna to say that he will no longer hold to his vows of chastity. Chitra finds that rather than make her happy, hearing this makes her extremely unhappy since he is not falling for her true self and tells him not to offer his heart to an illusion.\nLater the next day, Chitra admits to Madana and Vasanta that she had spurned Arjuna due to him falling for what she saw as a false image of herself. The two gods scold her as they had only given her what she had asked of them. Chitra replies that despite their gift, she sees the perfect beauty as a being separate from herself and that even if she had slept with Arjuna, it would not be the true her that he loved- only her beauty. Vasanta advises Chitra to go to Arjuna and spend the year with him and that at the year's end Arjuna will be able to embrace the true Chitra once the spell of perfect beauty is gone. Chitra does so, but throughout their year together she assumes that Arjuna will not love her once the year is up. After much time has passed, Arjuna begins to grow restless and longs to hunt once again. He also begins to ask Chitra questions about her past, wondering if she has anyone at home that is missing her. Chitra remarks that she has no past and that she's as transient as a drop of dew, which upsets Arjuna. With the year approaching its end, Chitra asks that the two gods make her last night her most beautiful, which they do.\nHowever around the same time Arjuna hears tales of the warrior Princess Chitra and begins to wonder what she might be like. Never having told him her name, Chitra assures Arjuna that he would never have noticed Chitra if he had passed by her and tries to coax him into bed. Arjuna declines, saying that some villagers have informed him that Maripur is under attack. Chitra assures him that the city is well protected, but to no avail. Arjuna's mind is occupied with thoughts of the princess, to which Chitra bitterly asks if he would love her more if she were like the Princess Chitra he admires. Arjuna replies that since she has always kept her true self a secret, he has never truly grown to love her as much as he could and that his love is \"incomplete\". Noticing that this upsets her, Arjuna tries to console his companion.\nThe play ends with Chitra finally admitting to Arjuna that she is the princess of which he spoke of and that she begged for beauty in order to win him over. She admits that she is not a perfect beauty, but that if he would accept her then she would remain with him forever. Chitra also admits that she is pregnant with his son. Arjuna meets this news with joy and states that his life is truly full.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK CHITRA ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Elliot S.

WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY\n\n\n\n                             PREFACE\n\nTHIS lyrical drama was written about twenty-five years ago. It is based\non the following story from the Mahabharata.\n\nIn the course of his wanderings, in fulfilment of a vow of penance,\nArjuna came to Manipur.  There he saw Chitrangada, the beautiful\ndaughter of Chitravahana, the king of the country. Smitten with her\ncharms, he asked the king for the hand of his daughter in marriage.\nChitravahana asked him who he was, and learning that he was Arjuna the\nPandara, told him that Prabhanjana, one of his ancestors in the kingly\nline of Manipur, had long been childless.  In order to obtain an heir,\nhe performed severe penances.  Pleased with these austerities, the god\nShiva gave him this boon, that he and his successors should each have\none child.  It so happened that the promised child had invariably been a\nson.  He, Chitravahana, was the first to have only a daughter\nChitrangada to perpetuate the race.  He had, therefore, always treated\nher as a son and had made her his heir.\n\nContinuing, the king said:\n\n\"The one son that will be born to her must be the perpetuator of my\nrace.  That son will be the price that I shall demand for this marriage.\nYou can take her, if you like, on this condition.\"\n\nArjuna promised and took Chitrangada to wife, and lived in her father's\ncapital for three years.  When a son was born to them, he embraced her\nwith affection, and taking leave of her and her father, set out again on\nhis travels.\n\n\n\n\nCHITRA\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\n\n  GODS:\n     MADANA (Eros).\n     VASANTA (Lycoris).\n\n  MORTALS:\n     CHITRA, daughter of the King of Manipur.\n     ARJUNA, a prince of the house of the Kurus.  He is of the\n  Kshatriya or \"warrior caste,\" and during the action is living as\n  a Hermit retired in the forest.\n\n  VILLAGERS from an outlying district of Manipur.\n\n  NOTE.--The dramatic poem \"Chitra\" has been performed in India\n  without scenery--the actors being surrounded by the audience.\n  Proposals for its production here having been made to him, he\n  went through this translation and provided stage directions, but\n  wished these omitted if it were printed as a book.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE I\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     ART thou the god with the five darts, the Lord of Love?\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     I am he who was the first born in the heart of the Creator.  I\n     bind in bonds of pain and bliss the lives of men and women!\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     I know, I know what that pain is and those bonds.--And who art\n     thou, my lord?\n\n\n                              Vasanta\n\n     I am his friend--Vasanta--the King of the Seasons.  Death and\n     decrepitude would wear the world to the bone but that I follow\n     them and constantly attack them.  I am Eternal Youth.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     I bow to thee, Lord Vasanta.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     But what stern vow is thine, fair stranger?  Why dost thou wither\n     thy fresh youth with penance and mortification?  Such a sacrifice\n     is not fit for the worship of love.  Who art thou and what is thy\n     prayer?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     I am Chitra, the daughter of the kingly house of Manipur.  With\n     godlike grace Lord Shiva promised to my royal grandsire an\n     unbroken line of male descent.  Nevertheless, the divine word\n     proved powerless to change the spark of life in my mother's womb\n     --so invincible was my nature, woman though I be.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     I know, that is why thy father brings thee up as his son.  He has\n     taught thee the use of the bow and all the duties of a king.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Yes, that is why I am dressed in man's attire and have left the\n     seclusion of a woman's chamber.  I know no feminine wiles for\n     winning hearts.  My hands are strong to bend the bow, but I have\n     never learnt Cupid's archery, the play of eyes.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     That requires no schooling, fair one.  The eye does its work\n     untaught, and he knows how well, who is struck in the heart.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     One day in search of game I roved alone to the forest on the bank\n     of the Purna river.  Tying my horse to a tree trunk I entered a\n     dense thicket on the track of a deer.  I found a narrow sinuous\n     path meandering through the dusk of the entangled boughs, the\n     foliage vibrated with the chirping of crickets, when of a sudden\n     I came upon a man lying on a bed of dried leaves, across my path.\n     I asked him haughtily to move aside, but he heeded not.  Then\n     with the sharp end of my bow I pricked him in contempt.\n     Instantly he leapt up with straight, tall limbs, like a sudden\n     tongue of fire from a heap of ashes.  An amused smile flickered\n     round the corners of his mouth, perhaps at the sight of my boyish\n     countenance.  Then for the first time in my life I felt myself a\n     woman, and knew that a man was before me.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     At the auspicious hour I teach the man and the woman this supreme\n     lesson to know themselves.  What happened after that?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     With fear and wonder I asked him \"Who are you?\" \"I am Arjuna,\" he\n     said, \"of the great Kuru clan.\"  I stood petrified like a statue,\n     and forgot to do him obeisance.  Was this indeed Arjuna, the one\n     great idol of my dreams!  Yes, I had long ago heard how he had\n     vowed a twelve-years' celibacy.  Many a day my young ambition had\n     spurred me on to break my lance with him, to challenge him in\n     disguise to single combat, and prove my skill in arms against\n     him.  Ah, foolish heart, whither fled thy presumption?  Could I\n     but exchange my youth with all its aspirations for the clod of\n     earth under his feet, I should deem it a most precious grace.  I\n     know not in what whirlpool of thought I was lost, when suddenly I\n     saw him vanish through the trees.  O foolish woman, neither didst\n     thou greet him, nor speak a word, nor beg forgiveness, but\n     stoodest like a barbarian boor while he contemptuously walked\n     away! . . . Next morning I laid aside my man's clothing.  I\n     donned bracelets, anklets, waist-chain, and a gown of purple red\n     silk. The unaccustomed dress clung about my shrinking shame; but\n     I hastened on my quest, and found Arjuna in the forest temple of\n     Shiva.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     Tell me the story to the end.  I am the heart-born god, and I\n     understand the mystery of these impulses.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Only vaguely can I remember what things I said, and what answer I\n     got.  Do not ask me to tell you all.  Shame fell on me like a\n     thunderbolt, yet could not break me to pieces, so utterly hard,\n     so like a man am I.  His last words as I walked home pricked my\n     ears like red hot needles.  \"I have taken the vow of celibacy.  I\n     am not fit to be thy husband!\"  Oh, the vow of a man!  Surely\n     thou knowest, thou god of love, that unnumbered saints and sages\n     have surrendered the merits of their life-long penance at the\n     feet of a woman.  I broke my bow in two and burnt my arrows in\n     the fire. I hated my strong, lithe arm, scored by drawing the\n     bowstring.  O Love, god Love, thou hast laid low in the dust the\n     vain pride of my manlike strength; and all my man's training lies\n     crushed under thy feet.  Now teach me thy lessons; give me the\n     power of the weak and the weapon of the unarmed hand.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     I will be thy friend.  I will bring the world-conquering Arjuna a\n     captive before thee, to accept his rebellion's sentence at thy\n     hand.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Had I but the time needed, I could win his heart by slow degrees,\n     and ask no help of the gods.  I would stand by his side as a\n     comrade, drive the fierce horses of his war-chariot, attend him\n     in the pleasures of the chase, keep guard at night at the\n     entrance of his tent, and help him in all the great duties of a\n     Kshatriya, rescuing the weak, and meting out justice where it is\n     due.  Surely at last the day would have come for him to look at\n     me and wonder, \"What boy is this?  Has one of my slaves in a\n     former life followed me like my good deeds into this?\"  I am not\n     the woman who nourishes her despair in lonely silence, feeding it\n     with nightly tears and covering it with the daily patient smile,\n     a widow from her birth.  The flower of my desire shall never drop\n     into the dust before it has ripened to fruit.  But it is the\n     labour of a life time to make one's true self known and honoured.\n     Therefore I have come to thy door, thou world-vanquishing Love,\n     and thou, Vasanta, youthful Lord of the Seasons, take from\n     my young body this primal injustice, an unattractive plainness.\n     For a single day make me superbly beautiful, even as beautiful as\n     was the sudden blooming of love in my heart.  Give me but one\n     brief day of perfect beauty, and I will answer for the days that\n     follow.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     Lady, I grant thy prayer.\n\n\n                              Vasanta\n\n     Not for the short span of a day, but for one whole year the charm\n     of spring blossoms shall nestle round thy limbs.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     WAS I dreaming or was what I saw by the lake truly there?\n     Sitting on the mossy turf, I mused over bygone years in the\n     sloping shadows of the evening, when slowly there came out from\n     the folding darkness of foliage an apparition of beauty in the\n     perfect form of a woman, and stood on a white slab of stone at\n     the water's brink.  It seemed that the heart of the earth must\n     heave in joy under her bare white feet.  Methought the vague\n     veilings of her body should melt in ecstasy into air as the\n     golden mist of dawn melts from off the snowy peak of the eastern\n     hill.  She bowed herself above the shining mirror of the lake and\n     saw the reflection of her face.  She started up in awe and stood\n     still; then smiled, and with a careless sweep of her left arm\n     unloosed her hair and let it trail on the earth at her feet.  She\n     bared her bosom and looked at her arms, so flawlessly modelled,\n     and instinct with an exquisite caress.  Bending her head she\n     saw the sweet blossoming of her youth and the tender bloom and\n     blush of her skin.  She beamed with a glad surprise.  So, if the\n     white lotus bud on opening her eyes in the morning were to arch\n     her neck and see her shadow in the water, would she wonder at\n     herself the livelong day.  But a moment after the smile passed\n     from her face and a shade of sadness crept into her eyes.  She\n     bound up her tresses, drew her veil over her arms, and sighing\n     slowly, walked away like a beauteous evening fading into the\n     night.  To me the supreme fulfilment of desire seemed to have\n     been revealed in a flash and then to have vanished. . . . But who\n     is it that pushes the door?\n\n\n              Enter CHITRA, dressed as a woman.\n\n     Ah!  it is she.  Quiet, my heart! . . . Fear me not, lady!  I am\n     a Kshatriya.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Honoured sir, you are my guest.  I live in this temple.  I know\n     not in what way I can show you hospitality.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Fair lady, the very sight of you is indeed the highest\n     hospitality.  If you will not take it amiss I would ask you a\n     question.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     You have permission.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     What stern vow keeps you immured in this solitary temple,\n     depriving all mortals of a vision of so much loveliness?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     I harbour a secret desire in my heart, for the fulfilment of\n     which I offer daily prayers to Lord Shiva.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Alas, what can you desire, you who are the desire of the whole\n     world!  From the easternmost hill on whose summit the morning sun\n     first prints his fiery foot to the end of the sunset land have I\n     travelled.  I have seen whatever is most precious, beautiful and\n     great on the earth.  My knowledge shall be yours, only say for\n     what or for whom you seek.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     He whom I seek is known to all.\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Indeed!  Who may this favourite of the gods be, whose fame has\n     captured your heart?\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Sprung from the highest of all royal houses, the greatest of all\n     heroes is he.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Lady, offer not such wealth of beauty as is yours on the altar of\n     false reputation.  Spurious fame spreads from tongue to tongue\n     like the fog of the early dawn before the sun rises.  Tell me who\n     in the highest of kingly lines is the supreme hero?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Hermit, you are jealous of other men's fame.  Do you not know\n     that all over the world the royal house of the Kurus is the most\n     famous?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     The house of the Kurus!\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     And have you never heard of the greatest name of that far-famed\n     house?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     From your own lips let me hear it.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Arjuna, the conqueror of the world.  I have culled from the\n     mouths of the multitude that imperishable name and hidden it with\n     care in my maiden heart.  Hermit, why do you look perturbed?  Has\n     that name only a deceitful glitter?  Say so, and I will not\n     hesitate to break this casket of my heart and throw the false gem\n     to the dust.\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n\n     Be his name and fame, his bravery and prowess false or true, for\n     mercy's sake do not banish him from your heart--for he kneels at\n     your feet even now.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     You, Arjuna!\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Yes, I am he, the love-hungered guest at your door.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Then it is not true that Arjuna has taken a vow of chastity for\n     twelve long years?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     But you have dissolved my vow even as the moon dissolves the\n     night's vow of obscurity.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Oh, shame upon you!  What have you seen in me that makes you\n     false to yourself?  Whom do you seek in these dark eyes, in these\n     milk-white arms, if you are ready to pay for her the price of\n     your probity?  Not my true self, I know.  Surely this cannot be\n     love, this is not man's highest homage to woman!  Alas, that this\n     frail disguise, the body, should make one blind to the light of\n     the deathless spirit!  Yes, now indeed, I know, Arjuna, the fame\n     of your heroic manhood is false.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Ah, I feel how vain is fame, the pride of prowess!  Everything\n     seems to me a dream.  You alone are perfect; you are the wealth\n     of the world, the end of all poverty, the goal of all efforts,\n     the one woman!  Others there are who can be but slowly known.\n     While to see you for a moment is to see perfect completeness\n     once and for ever.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Alas, it is not I, not I, Arjuna!  It is the deceit of a god.\n     Go, go, my hero, go.  Woo not falsehood, offer not your great\n     heart to an illusion.  Go.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     No, impossible.  To face that fervent gaze that almost grasps you\n     like clutching hands of the hungry spirit within; to feel his\n     heart struggling to break its bounds urging its passionate cry\n     through the entire body--and then to send him away like a\n     beggar--no, impossible.\n\n\n                  Enter MADANA and VASANTA.\n\n     Ah, god of love, what fearful flame is this with which thou hast\n     enveloped me!  I burn, and I burn whatever I touch.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     I desire to know what happened last night.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     At evening I lay down on a grassy bed strewn with the petals of\n     spring flowers, and recollected the wonderful praise of my beauty\n     I had heard from Arjuna;--drinking drop by drop the honey that I\n     had stored during the long day.  The history of my past life like\n     that of my former existences was forgotten.  I felt like a\n     flower, which has but a few fleeting hours to listen to all the\n     humming flatteries and whispered murmurs of the woodlands and\n     then must lower its eyes from the Sky, bend its head and at a\n     breath give itself up to the dust without a cry, thus ending the\n     short story of a perfect moment that has neither past nor future.\n\n\n                              Vasanta\n\n     A limitless life of glory can bloom and spend itself in a\n     morning.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     Like an endless meaning in the narrow span of a song.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     The southern breeze caressed me to sleep.  From the flowering\n     Malati bower overhead silent kisses dropped over my body.\n     On my hair, my breast, my feet, each flower chose a bed to die\n     on.  I slept.  And, suddenly in the depth of my sleep, I felt as\n     if some intense eager look, like tapering fingers of flame,\n     touched my slumbering body.  I started up and saw the Hermit\n     standing before me.  The moon had moved to the west, peering\n     through the leaves to espy this wonder of divine art wrought in a\n     fragile human frame.  The air was heavy with perfume; the silence\n     of the night was vocal with the chirping of crickets; the\n     reflections of the trees hung motionless in the lake; and with\n     his staff in his hand he stood, tall and straight and still, like\n     a forest tree.  It seemed to me that I had, on opening my eyes,\n     died to all realities of life and undergone a dream birth into a\n     shadow land.  Shame slipped to my feet like loosened clothes.  I\n     heard his call--\"Beloved, my most beloved!\"  And all my forgotten\n     lives united as one and responded to it.  I said, \"Take me, take\n     all I am!\"  And I stretched out my arms to him.  The moon set\n     behind the trees.  One curtain of darkness covered all.  Heaven\n     and earth, time and space, pleasure and pain, death and life\n     merged together in an unbearable ecstasy. . . . With the first\n     gleam of light, the first twitter of birds, I rose up and sat\n     leaning on my left arm.  He lay asleep with a vague smile about\n     his lips like the crescent moon in the morning.  The rosy red\n     glow of the dawn fell upon his noble forehead.  I sighed and\n     stood up.  I drew together the leafy lianas to screen the\n     streaming sun from his face.  I looked about me and saw the same\n     old earth.  I remembered what I used to be, and ran and ran like\n     a deer afraid of her own shadow, through the forest path strewn\n     with shephali flowers.  I found a lonely nook, and sitting down\n     covered my face with both hands, and tried to weep and cry.  But\n     no tears came to my eyes.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     Alas, thou daughter of mortals!  I stole from the divine\n     Storehouse the fragrant wine of heaven, filled with it one\n     earthly night to the brim, and placed it in thy hand to drink--\n     yet still I hear this cry of anguish!\n\n\n                      Chitra [bitterly]\n\n     Who drank it?  The rarest completion of life's desire, the first\n     union of love was proffered to me, but was wrested from my grasp?\n     This borrowed beauty, this falsehood that enwraps me, will slip\n     from me taking with it the only monument of that sweet union, as\n     the petals fall from an overblown flower; and the woman ashamed\n     of her naked poverty will sit weeping day and night.  Lord Love,\n     this cursed appearance companions me like a demon robbing me of\n     all the prizes of love--all the kisses for which my heart is\n     athirst.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     Alas, how vain thy single night had been!  The barque of joy came\n     in sight, but the waves would not let it touch the shore.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Heaven came so close to my hand that I forgot for a moment that\n     it had not reached me.  But when I woke in the morning from my\n     dream I found that my body had become my own rival.  It is my\n     hateful task to deck her every day, to send her to my beloved and\n     see her caressed by him.  O god, take back thy boon!\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     But if I take it from you how can you stand before your lover?\n     To snatch away the cup from his lips when he has scarcely drained\n     his first draught of pleasure, would not that be cruel?  With\n     what resentful anger he must regard thee then?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     That would be better far than this.  I will reveal my true self\n     to him, a nobler thing than this disguise.  If he rejects it, if\n     he spurns me and breaks my heart, I will bear even that in\n     silence.\n\n\n                              Vasanta\n\n     Listen to my advice.  When with the advent of autumn the\n     flowering season is over then comes the triumph of fruitage.  A\n     time will come of itself when the heat-cloyed bloom of the body\n     will droop and Arjuna will gladly accept the abiding fruitful\n     truth in thee.  O child, go back to thy mad festival.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     WHY do you watch me like that, my warrior?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     I watch how you weave that garland.  Skill and grace, the twin\n     brother and sister, are dancing playfully on your finger tips.  I\n     am watching and thinking.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     What are you thinking, sir?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     I am thinking that you, with this same lightness of touch and\n     sweetness, are weaving my days of exile into an immortal wreath,\n     to crown me when I return home.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Home!  But this love is not for a home!\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Not for a home?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     No.  Never talk of that.  Take to your home what is abiding and\n     strong.  Leave the little wild flower where it was born; leave it\n     beautifully to die at the day's end among all fading blossoms and\n     decaying leaves.   Do not take it to your palace hall to fling it\n     on the stony floor which knows no pity for things that fade and\n     are forgotten.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Is ours that kind of love?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Yes, no other!  Why regret it?  That which was meant for idle\n     days should never outlive them.  Joy turns into pain when the\n     door by which it should depart is shut against it.  Take it and\n     keep it as long as it lasts.  Let not the satiety of your evening\n     claim more than the desire of your morning could earn. . . . The\n     day is done.  Put this garland on.  I am tired.  Take me in your\n     arms, my love.  Let all vain bickerings of discontent die away at\n     the sweet meeting of our lips.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Hush!  Listen, my beloved, the sound of prayer bells from the\n     distant village temple steals upon the evening air across the\n     silent trees!\n\n\n\n\nSCENE V\n\n                              Vasanta\n\n     I CANNOT keep pace with thee, my friend!  I am tired.  It is a\n     hard task to keep alive the fire thou hast kindled.  Sleep\n     overtakes me, the fan drops from my hand, and cold ashes cover\n     the glow of the fire.  I start up again from my slumber and with\n     all my might rescue the weary flame.  But this can go on no\n     longer.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     I know, thou art as fickle as a child.  Ever restless is thy play\n     in heaven and on earth.  Things that thou for days buildest up\n     with endless detail thou dost shatter in a moment without regret.\n     But this work of ours is nearly finished.  Pleasure-winged days\n     fly fast, and the year, almost at its end, swoons in rapturous\n     bliss.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VI\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n\n     I WOKE in the morning and found that my dreams had distilled a\n     gem.  I have no casket to inclose it, no king's crown whereon to\n     fix it, no chain from which to hang it, and yet have not the\n     heart to throw it away.  My Kshatriya's right arm, idly occupied\n     in holding it, forgets its duties.\n\n\n                           Enter CHITRA.\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Tell me your thoughts, sir!\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     My mind is busy with thoughts of hunting today.  See, how the\n     rain pours in torrents and fiercely beats upon the hillside.  The\n     dark shadow of the clouds hangs heavily over the forest, and the\n     swollen stream, like reckless youth, overleaps all barriers with\n     mocking laughter.  On such rainy days we five brothers would go\n     to the Chitraka forest to chase wild beasts.  Those were glad\n     times. Our hearts danced to the drumbeat of rumbling clouds.  The\n     woods resounded with the screams of peacocks.  Timid deer could\n     not hear our approaching steps for the patter of rain and the\n     noise of waterfalls; the leopards would leave their tracks on the\n     wet earth, betraying their lairs.  Our sport over, we dared each\n     other to swim across turbulent streams on our way back home.  The\n     restless spirit is on me.  I long to go hunting.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     First run down the quarry you are now following.  Are you quite\n     certain that the enchanted deer you pursue must needs be caught?\n     No, not yet.  Like a dream the wild creature eludes you when it\n     seems most nearly yours.  Look how the wind is chased by the mad\n     rain that discharges a thousand arrows after it.  Yet it goes\n     free and unconquered.  Our sport is like that, my love!  You give\n     chase to the fleet-footed spirit of beauty, aiming at her every\n     dart you have in your hands.  Yet this magic deer runs ever free\n     and untouched.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     My love, have you no home where kind hearts are waiting for your\n     return?  A home which you once made sweet with your gentle\n     service and whose light went out when you left it for this\n     wilderness?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Why these questions?  Are the hours of unthinking pleasure over?\n     Do you not know that I am no more than what you see before you?\n     For me there is no vista beyond.  The dew that hangs on the tip\n     of a Kinsuka petal has neither name nor destination.  It offers\n     no answer to any question.  She whom you love is like that\n     perfect bead of dew.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Has she no tie with the world?  Can she be merely like a fragment\n     of heaven dropped on the earth through the carelessness of a\n     wanton god?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Yes.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Ah, that is why I always seem about to lose you.  My heart is\n     unsatisfied, my mind knows no peace.  Come closer to me,\n     unattainable one!  Surrender yourself to the bonds of name and\n     home and parentage.  Let my heart feel you on all sides and live\n     with you in the peaceful security of love.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Why this vain effort to catch and keep the tints of the clouds,\n     the dance of the waves, the smell of the flowers?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Mistress mine, do not hope to pacify love with airy nothings.\n     Give me something to clasp, something that can last longer than\n     pleasure, that can endure even through suffering.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Hero mine, the year is not yet full, and you are tired already!\n     Now I know that it is Heaven's blessing that has made the\n     flower's term of life short.  Could this body of mine have\n     drooped and died with the flowers of last spring it surely would\n     have died with honour.  Yet, its days are numbered, my love.\n     Spare it not, press it dry of honey, for fear your beggar's heart\n     come back to it again and again with unsated desire, like a\n     thirsty bee when summer blossoms lie dead in the dust.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VII\n\n                               Madana\n\n     TONIGHT is thy last night.\n\n\n                              Vasanta\n\n     The loveliness of your body will return tomorrow to the\n     inexhaustible stores of the spring.  The ruddy tint of thy lips\n     freed from the memory of Arjuna's kisses, will bud anew as a pair\n     of fresh asoka leaves, and the soft, white glow of thy skin will\n     be born again in a hundred fragrant jasmine flowers.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     O gods, grant me this my prayer!  Tonight, in its last hour let\n     my beauty flash its brightest, like the final flicker of a dying\n     flame.\n\n\n                               Madana\n\n     Thou shalt have thy wish.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII\n\n                             Villagers\n\n     WHO will protect us now?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Why, by what danger are you threatened?\n\n\n                             Villagers\n\n     The robbers are pouring from the northern hills like a mountain\n     flood to devastate our village.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Have you in this kingdom no warden?\n\n\n                             Villagers\n\n     Princess Chitra was the terror of all evil doers.  While she was\n     in this happy land we feared natural deaths, but had no other\n     fears.  Now she has gone on a pilgrimage, and none knows where to\n     find her.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Is the warden of this country a woman?\n\n\n                             Villagers\n\n\n     Yes, she is our father and mother in one.\n                                                       [Exeunt.\n\n\n                           Enter CHITRA.\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Why are you sitting all alone?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     I am trying to imagine what kind of woman Princess Chitra may be.\n     I hear so many stories of her from all sorts of men.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Ah, but she is not beautiful.  She has no such lovely eyes as\n     mine, dark as death.  She can pierce any target she will, but not\n     our hero's heart.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     They say that in valour she is a man, and a woman in tenderness.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     That, indeed, is her greatest misfortune.  When a woman is merely\n     a woman; when she winds herself round and round men's hearts with\n     her smiles and sobs and services and caressing endearments; then\n     she is happy.  Of what use to her are learning and great\n     achievements?  Could you have seen her only yesterday in the\n     court of the Lord Shiva's temple by the forest path, you would\n     have passed by without deigning to look at her.  But have you\n     grown so weary of woman's beauty that you seek in her for a man's\n     strength?\n\n     With green leaves wet from the spray of the foaming waterfall, I\n     have made our noonday bed in a cavern dark as night.  There the\n     cool of the soft green mosses thick on the black and dripping\n     stone, kisses your eyes to sleep.  Let me guide you thither.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Not today, beloved.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Why not today?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     I have heard that a horde of robbers has neared the plains.\n     Needs must I go and prepare my weapons to protect the frightened\n     villagers.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     You need have no fear for them.  Before she started on her\n     pilgrimage, Princess Chitra had set strong guards at all the\n     frontier passes.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Yet permit me for a short while to set about a Kshatriya's work.\n     With new glory will I ennoble this idle arm, and make of it a\n     pillow more worthy of your head.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     What if I refuse to let you go, if I keep you entwined in my\n     arms?  Would you rudely snatch yourself free and leave me?  Go\n     then!  But you must know that the liana, once broken in two,\n     never joins again.  Go, if your thirst is quenched.  But, if not,\n     then remember that the goddess of pleasure is fickle, and waits\n     for no man.  Sit for a while, my lord!  Tell me what uneasy\n     thoughts tease you.  Who occupied your mind today?  Is it Chitra?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Yes, it is Chitra.  I wonder in fulfilment of what vow she has\n     gone on her pilgrimage.  Of what could she stand in need?\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Her needs?  Why, what has she ever had, the unfortunate creature?\n     Her very qualities are as prison walls, shutting her woman's\n     heart in a bare cell.  She is obscured, she is unfulfilled.  Her\n     womanly love must content itself dressed in rags; beauty is\n     denied  her.   She  is like the spirit of  a  cheerless  morning,\n     sitting upon the stony mountain peak, all her light blotted out\n     by dark clouds.  Do not ask me of her life.  It will never sound\n     sweet to man's ear.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     I am eager to learn all about her.  I am like a traveller come to\n     a strange city at midnight.  Domes and towers and garden-trees\n     look vague and shadowy, and the dull moan of the sea comes\n     fitfully through the silence of sleep.  Wistfully he waits for\n     the morning to reveal to him all the strange wonders.  Oh, tell\n     me her story.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     What more is there to tell?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     I seem to see her, in my mind's eye, riding on a white horse,\n     proudly holding the reins in her left hand, and in her right a\n     bow, and like the Goddess of Victory dispensing glad hope all\n     round her.  Like a watchful lioness she protects the litter at\n     her dugs with a fierce love.  Woman's arms, though adorned with\n     naught but unfettered strength, are beautiful!  My heart is\n     restless, fair one, like a serpent reviving from his long\n     winter's sleep.  Come, let us both race on swift horses side by\n     side, like twin orbs of light sweeping through space.  Out from\n     this slumbrous prison of green gloom, this dank, dense cover of\n     perfumed intoxication, choking breath.\n\n\n                               Chitra\n\n     Arjuna, tell me true, if, now at once, by some magic I could\n     shake myself free from this voluptuous softness, this timid bloom\n     of beauty shrinking from the rude and healthy touch of the world,\n     and fling it from my body like borrowed clothes, would you be\n     able to bear it?  If I stand up straight and strong with the\n     strength of a daring heart spurning the wiles and arts of twining\n     weakness, if I hold my head high like a tall young mountain fir,\n     no longer trailing in the dust like a liana, shall I then appeal\n     to man's eye?   No, no, you could not endure it.  It is better\n     that I should keep spread about me all the dainty playthings of\n     fugitive youth, and wait for you in patience.  When it pleases\n     you to return, I will smilingly pour out for you the wine of\n     pleasure in the cup of this beauteous body.  When you are tired\n     and satiated with this wine, you can go to work or play; and when\n     I grow old I will accept humbly and gratefully whatever corner is\n     left for me.  Would it please your heroic soul if the playmate of\n     the night aspired to be the helpmeet of the day, if the left arm\n     learnt to share the burden of the proud right arm?\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     I never seem to know you aright.  You seem to me like a goddess\n     hidden within a golden image.  I cannot touch you, I cannot pay\n     you my dues in return for your priceless gifts.  Thus my love is\n     incomplete.  Sometimes in the enigmatic depth of your sad look,\n     in your playful words mocking at their own meaning, I gain\n     glimpses of a being trying to rend asunder the languorous grace\n     of her body, to emerge in a chaste fire of pain through a\n     vaporous veil of smiles.  Illusion is the first appearance of\n     Truth.  She advances towards her lover in disguise.  But a time\n     comes when she throws off her ornaments and veils and stands\n     clothed in naked dignity.  I grope for that ultimate you, that\n     bare simplicity of truth.\n\n     Why these tears, my love?  Why cover your face with your hands?\n     Have I pained you, my darling?  Forget what I said.  I will be\n     content with the present.  Let each separate moment of beauty\n     come to me like a bird of mystery from its unseen nest in the\n     dark  bearing  a message of music.  Let me for ever sit  with\n     my hope on the brink of its realization, and thus end my days.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IX\n\n                         CHITRA and ARJUNA\n\n                      Chitra [cloaked]\n\n     My lord, has the cup been drained to the last drop?  Is this,\n     indeed, the end? No, when all is done something still remains,\n     and that is my last sacrifice at your feet.\n\n     I brought from the garden of heaven flowers of incomparable\n     beauty with which to worship you, god of my heart.  If the rites\n     are over, if the flowers have faded, let me throw them out of the\n     temple [unveiling in her original male attire].  Now, look\n     at your worshipper with gracious eyes.\n\n     I am not beautifully perfect as the flowers with which I\n     worshipped.  I have many flaws and blemishes.  I am a\n     traveller in the great world-path, my garments are dirty,\n     and my feet are bleeding with thorns.  Where should I achieve\n     flower-beauty, the unsullied loveliness of a moment's life?  The\n     gift that I proudly bring you is the heart of a woman.  Here have\n     all pains and joys gathered, the hopes and fears and shames of a\n     daughter of the dust; here love springs up struggling toward\n     immortal life.  Herein lies an imperfection which yet is noble\n     and grand.  If the flower-service is finished, my master, accept\n     this as your servant for the days to come!\n\n     I am Chitra, the king's daughter.  Perhaps you will remember the\n     day when a woman came to you in the temple of Shiva, her body\n     loaded with ornaments and finery.  That shameless woman came to\n     court you as though she were a man.  You rejected her; you did\n     well.  My lord, I am that woman.  She was my disguise.  Then by\n     the boon of gods I obtained for a year the most radiant form that\n     a mortal ever wore, and wearied my hero's heart with the burden\n     of that deceit.  Most surely I am not that woman.\n\n     I am Chitra.  No goddess to be worshipped, nor yet the\n     object of common pity to be brushed aside like a moth with\n     indifference.  If you deign to keep me by your side in the path\n     of danger and daring, if you allow me to share the great duties\n     of your life, then you will know my true self.  If your babe,\n     whom  I  am nourishing in my womb be born a son, I  shall  myself\n     teach him to be a second Arjuna, and send him to you when the\n     time comes, and then at last you will truly know me. Today I can\n     only offer you Chitra, the daughter of a king.\n\n\n                               Arjuna\n\n     Beloved, my life is full.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Chitra, by Rabindranath Tagore"}

Grassou paints forgeries of works by Titian, Raphael, and other famous artists. Magus resells these forgeries for a large profit to members of the Petite bourgeoisie who are incapable of appreciating good art.\nMonsieur Vervelle, a prosperous bottle-dealer obsessed with art, is introduced to Grassou by Magus, who introduces the painter as a grand master. Vervelle and his wife are enchanted with Grassou and believe he would make a good match for their daughter Virginie.\nGrassou is invited to Ville-d'Avray, where the Vervelle mansion is garishly decorated, and also includes a large collection of Grassou’s work, including the forgery of a Titian. Grassou recognizes his own mediocrity, but when it is discovered by the Vervelles that the forgeries in their home were painted by Grassou, “far from denting his reputation, multiples Grassou’s value as an artist” and as a son-in-law, since Vervelle believes Grassou to possess all the combined talent of Rubens, Rembrandt, Terburg, and Titian.\nDespite his advantageous marriage, Grassou remains bitter that he is not a true artist. “This painter, a good father and a good husband, is unable to eradicate from his heart a fatal thought, namely, that artists laugh at his work; that his name is a term of contempt in the studios; and that the feuilletons take no notice of his pictures. But he still works on; he aims for the Academy, where, undoubtedly, he will enter.\"", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK PIERRE GRASSOU ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by John Bickers and Dagny\n\n\n\n\n\nPIERRE GRASSOU\n\n\nBy Honore De Balzac\n\n\n\nTranslated by Katharine Prescott Wormeley\n\n\n\nDedication\n\nTo The Lieutenant-Colonel of Artillery, Periollas, As a Testimony of the\nAffectionate Esteem of the Author,\n\nDe Balzac\n\n\n\n\n\nPIERRE GRASSOU\n\n\nWhenever you have gone to take a serious look at the exhibition of works\nof sculpture and painting, such as it has been since the revolution\nof 1830, have you not been seized by a sense of uneasiness, weariness,\nsadness, at the sight of those long and over-crowded galleries? Since\n1830, the true Salon no longer exists. The Louvre has again been taken\nby assault,--this time by a populace of artists who have maintained\nthemselves in it.\n\nIn other days, when the Salon presented only the choicest works of art,\nit conferred the highest honor on the creations there exhibited. Among\nthe two hundred selected paintings, the public could still choose: a\ncrown was awarded to the masterpiece by hands unseen. Eager, impassioned\ndiscussions arose about some picture. The abuse showered on Delacroix,\non Ingres, contributed no less to their fame than the praises and\nfanaticism of their adherents. To-day, neither the crowd nor the\ncriticism grows impassioned about the products of that bazaar. Forced to\nmake the selection for itself, which in former days the examining\njury made for it, the attention of the public is soon wearied and the\nexhibition closes. Before the year 1817 the pictures admitted never went\nbeyond the first two columns of the long gallery of the old masters; but\nin that year, to the great astonishment of the public, they filled the\nwhole space. Historical, high-art, genre paintings, easel pictures,\nlandscapes, flowers, animals, and water-colors,--these eight specialties\ncould surely not offer more than twenty pictures in one year worthy of\nthe eyes of the public, which, indeed, cannot give its attention to a\ngreater number of such works. The more the number of artists increases,\nthe more careful and exacting the jury of admission ought to be.\n\nThe true character of the Salon was lost as soon as it spread along\nthe galleries. The Salon should have remained within fixed limits of\ninflexible proportions, where each distinct specialty could show its\nmasterpieces only. An experience of ten years has shown the excellence\nof the former institution. Now, instead of a tournament, we have a mob;\ninstead of a noble exhibition, we have a tumultuous bazaar; instead of\na choice selection we have a chaotic mass. What is the result? A great\nartist is swamped. Decamps' \"Turkish Cafe,\" \"Children at a Fountain,\"\n\"Joseph,\" and \"The Torture,\" would have redounded far more to his credit\nif the four pictures had been exhibited in the great Salon with the\nhundred good pictures of that year, than his twenty pictures could,\namong three thousand others, jumbled together in six galleries.\n\nBy some strange contradiction, ever since the doors are open to every\none there has been much talk of unknown and unrecognized genius. When,\ntwelve years earlier, Ingres' \"Courtesan,\" and that of Sigalon, the\n\"Medusa\" of Gericault, the \"Massacre of Scio\" by Delacroix, the \"Baptism\nof Henri IV.\" by Eugene Deveria, admitted by celebrated artists accused\nof jealousy, showed the world, in spite of the denials of criticism,\nthat young and vigorous palettes existed, no such complaint was made.\nNow, when the veriest dauber of canvas can send in his work, the whole\ntalk is of genius neglected! Where judgment no longer exists, there is\nno longer anything judged. But whatever artists may be doing now, they\nwill come back in time to the examination and selection which presents\ntheir works to the admiration of the crowd for whom they work. Without\nselection by the Academy there will be no Salon, and without the Salon\nart may perish.\n\nEver since the catalogue has grown into a book, many names have appeared\nin it which still remain in their native obscurity, in spite of the ten\nor a dozen pictures attached to them. Among these names perhaps the most\nunknown to fame is that of an artist named Pierre Grassou, coming from\nFougeres, and called simply \"Fougeres\" among his brother-artists, who,\nat the present moment holds a place, as the saying is, \"in the sun,\" and\nwho suggested the rather bitter reflections by which this sketch of\nhis life is introduced,--reflections that are applicable to many other\nindividuals of the tribe of artists.\n\nIn 1832, Fougeres lived in the rue de Navarin, on the fourth floor of\none of those tall, narrow houses which resemble the obelisk of Luxor,\nand possess an alley, a dark little stairway with dangerous turnings,\nthree windows only on each floor, and, within the building, a courtyard,\nor, to speak more correctly, a square pit or well. Above the three or\nfour rooms occupied by Grassou of Fougeres was his studio, looking over\nto Montmartre. This studio was painted in brick-color, for a background;\nthe floor was tinted brown and well frotted; each chair was furnished\nwith a bit of carpet bound round the edges; the sofa, simple enough, was\nclean as that in the bedroom of some worthy bourgeoise. All these things\ndenoted the tidy ways of a small mind and the thrift of a poor man. A\nbureau was there, in which to put away the studio implements, a table\nfor breakfast, a sideboard, a secretary; in short, all the articles\nnecessary to a painter, neatly arranged and very clean. The stove\nparticipated in this Dutch cleanliness, which was all the more visible\nbecause the pure and little changing light from the north flooded with\nits cold clear beams the vast apartment. Fougeres, being merely a genre\npainter, does not need the immense machinery and outfit which ruin\nhistorical painters; he has never recognized within himself sufficient\nfaculty to attempt high-art, and he therefore clings to easel painting.\n\nAt the beginning of the month of December of that year, a season at\nwhich the bourgeois of Paris conceive, periodically, the burlesque idea\nof perpetuating their forms and figures already too bulky in themselves,\nPierre Grassou, who had risen early, prepared his palette, and lighted\nhis stove, was eating a roll steeped in milk, and waiting till the frost\non his windows had melted sufficiently to let the full light in. The\nweather was fine and dry. At this moment the artist, who ate his bread\nwith that patient, resigned air that tells so much, heard and recognized\nthe step of a man who had upon his life the influence such men have\non the lives of nearly all artists,--the step of Elie Magus, a\npicture-dealer, a usurer in canvas. The next moment Elie Magus entered\nand found the painter in the act of beginning his work in the tidy\nstudio.\n\n\"How are you, old rascal?\" said the painter.\n\nFougeres had the cross of the Legion of honor, and Elie Magus bought his\npictures at two and three hundred francs apiece, so he gave himself the\nairs of a fine artist.\n\n\"Business is very bad,\" replied Elie. \"You artists have such\npretensions! You talk of two hundred francs when you haven't put six\nsous' worth of color on a canvas. However, you are a good fellow, I'll\nsay that. You are steady; and I've come to put a good bit of business in\nyour way.\"\n\n\"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,\" said Fougeres. \"Do you know Latin?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, it means that the Greeks never proposed a good bit of business\nto the Trojans without getting their fair share of it. In the olden time\nthey used to say, 'Take my horse.' Now we say, 'Take my bear.' Well,\nwhat do you want, Ulysses-Lagingeole-Elie Magus?\"\n\nThese words will give an idea of the mildness and wit with which\nFougeres employed what painters call studio fun.\n\n\"Well, I don't deny that you are to paint me two pictures for nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"I'll leave you to do it, or not; I don't ask it. But you're an honest\nman.\"\n\n\"Come, out with it!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm prepared to bring you a father, mother, and only daughter.\"\n\n\"All for me?\"\n\n\"Yes--they want their portraits taken. These bourgeois--they are crazy\nabout art--have never dared to enter a studio. The girl has a 'dot' of a\nhundred thousand francs. You can paint all three,--perhaps they'll turn\nout family portraits.\"\n\nAnd with that the old Dutch log of wood who passed for a man and who was\ncalled Elie Magus, interrupted himself to laugh an uncanny laugh which\nfrightened the painter. He fancied he heard Mephistopheles talking\nmarriage.\n\n\"Portraits bring five hundred francs apiece,\" went on Elie; \"so you can\nvery well afford to paint me three pictures.\"\n\n\"True for you!\" cried Fougeres, gleefully.\n\n\"And if you marry the girl, you won't forget me.\"\n\n\"Marry! I?\" cried Pierre Grassou,--\"I, who have a habit of sleeping\nalone; and get up at cock-crow, and all my life arranged--\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs,\" said Magus, \"and a quiet girl, full of\ngolden tones, as you call 'em, like a Titian.\"\n\n\"What class of people are they?\"\n\n\"Retired merchants; just now in love with art; have a country-house at\nVille d'Avray, and ten or twelve thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"What business did they do?\"\n\n\"Bottles.\"\n\n\"Now don't say that word; it makes me think of corks and sets my teeth\non edge.\"\n\n\"Am I to bring them?\"\n\n\"Three portraits--I could put them in the Salon; I might go in for\nportrait-painting. Well, yes!\"\n\nOld Elie descended the staircase to go in search of the Vervelle family.\nTo know to what extend this proposition would act upon the painter, and\nwhat effect would be produced upon him by the Sieur and Dame Vervelle,\nadorned by their only daughter, it is necessary to cast an eye on the\nanterior life of Pierre Grassou of Fougeres.\n\nWhen a pupil, Fougeres had studied drawing with Servin, who was\nthought a great draughtsman in academic circles. After that he went to\nSchinner's, to learn the secrets of the powerful and magnificent color\nwhich distinguishes that master. Master and scholars were all discreet;\nat any rate Pierre discovered none of their secrets. From there he went\nto Sommervieux' atelier, to acquire that portion of the art of painting\nwhich is called composition, but composition was shy and distant to him.\nThen he tried to snatch from Decamps and Granet the mystery of their\ninterior effects. The two masters were not robbed. Finally Fougeres\nended his education with Duval-Lecamus. During these studied and\nthese different transformations Fougeres' habits and ways of life were\ntranquil and moral to a degree that furnished matter of jesting to the\nvarious ateliers where he sojourned; but everywhere he disarmed his\ncomrades by his modesty and by the patience and gentleness of a lamblike\nnature. The masters, however, had no sympathy for the good lad; masters\nprefer bright fellows, eccentric spirits, droll or fiery, or else gloomy\nand deeply reflective, which argue future talent. Everything about\nPierre Grassou smacked of mediocrity. His nickname \"Fougeres\" (that\nof the painter in the play of \"The Eglantine\") was the source of much\nteasing; but, by force of circumstances, he accepted the name of the\ntown in which he had first seen light.\n\nGrassou of Fougeres resembled his name. Plump and of medium height, he\nhad a dull complexion, brown eyes, black hair, a turned-up nose, rather\nwide mouth, and long ears. His gentle, passive, and resigned air gave a\ncertain relief to these leading features of a physiognomy that was full\nof health, but wanting in action. This young man, born to be a virtuous\nbourgeois, having left his native place and come to Paris to be clerk\nwith a color-merchant (formerly of Mayenne and a distant connection of\nthe Orgemonts) made himself a painter simply by the fact of an obstinacy\nwhich constitutes the Breton character. What he suffered, the manner in\nwhich he lived during those years of study, God only knows. He suffered\nas much as great men suffer when they are hounded by poverty and hunted\nlike wild beasts by the pack of commonplace minds and by troops of\nvanities athirst for vengeance.\n\nAs soon as he thought himself able to fly on his own wings, Fougeres\ntook a studio in the upper part of the rue des Martyrs, where he began\nto delve his way. He made his first appearance in 1819. The first\npicture he presented to the jury of the Exhibition at the Louvre\nrepresented a village wedding rather laboriously copied from Greuze's\npicture. It was rejected. When Fougeres heard of the fatal decision,\nhe did not fall into one of those fits of epileptic self-love to which\nstrong natures give themselves up, and which sometimes end in challenges\nsent to the director or the secretary of the Museum, or even by threats\nof assassination. Fougeres quietly fetched his canvas, wrapped it in\na handkerchief, and brought it home, vowing in his heart that he would\nstill make himself a great painter. He placed his picture on the easel,\nand went to one of his former masters, a man of immense talent,--to\nSchinner, a kind and patient artist, whose triumph at that year's Salon\nwas complete. Fougeres asked him to come and criticise the rejected\nwork. The great painter left everything and went at once. When poor\nFougeres had placed the work before him Schinner, after a glance,\npressed Fougeres' hand.\n\n\"You are a fine fellow,\" he said; \"you've a heart of gold, and I must\nnot deceive you. Listen; you are fulfilling all the promises you made in\nthe studios. When you find such things as that at the tip of your brush,\nmy good Fougeres, you had better leave colors with Brullon, and not take\nthe canvas of others. Go home early, put on your cotton night-cap, and\nbe in bed by nine o'clock. The next morning early go to some government\noffice, ask for a place, and give up art.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Fougeres, \"my picture is already condemned; it is\nnot a verdict that I want of you, but the cause of that verdict.\"\n\n\"Well--you paint gray and sombre; you see nature being a crape veil;\nyour drawing is heavy, pasty; your composition is a medley of Greuze,\nwho only redeemed his defects by the qualities which you lack.\"\n\nWhile detailing these faults of the picture Schinner saw on Fougeres'\nface so deep an expression of sadness that he carried him off to dinner\nand tried to console him. The next morning at seven o'clock Fougeres was\nat his easel working over the rejected picture; he warmed the colors; he\nmade the corrections suggested by Schinner, he touched up his figures.\nThen, disgusted with such patching, he carried the picture to Elie\nMagus. Elie Magus, a sort of Dutch-Flemish-Belgian, had three reasons\nfor being what he became,--rich and avaricious. Coming last from\nBordeaux, he was just starting in Paris, selling old pictures and living\non the boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle. Fougeres, who relied on his palette\nto go to the baker's, bravely ate bread and nuts, or bread and milk, or\nbread and cherries, or bread and cheese, according to the seasons. Elie\nMagus, to whom Pierre offered his first picture, eyed it for some time\nand then gave him fifteen francs.\n\n\"With fifteen francs a year coming in, and a thousand francs for\nexpenses,\" said Fougeres, smiling, \"a man will go fast and far.\"\n\nElie Magus made a gesture; he bit his thumbs, thinking that he might\nhave had that picture for five francs.\n\nFor several days Pierre walked down from the rue des Martyrs and\nstationed himself at the corner of the boulevard opposite to Elie's\nshop, whence his eye could rest upon his picture, which did not obtain\nany notice from the eyes of the passers along the street. At the end of\na week the picture disappeared; Fougeres walked slowly up and approached\nthe dealer's shop in a lounging manner. The Jew was at his door.\n\n\"Well, I see you have sold my picture.\"\n\n\"No, here it is,\" said Magus; \"I've framed it, to show it to some one\nwho fancies he knows about painting.\"\n\nFougeres had not the heart to return to the boulevard. He set about\nanother picture, and spent two months upon it,--eating mouse's meals and\nworking like a galley-slave.\n\nOne evening he went to the boulevard, his feet leading him fatefully to\nthe dealer's shop. His picture was not to be seen.\n\n\"I've sold your picture,\" said Elie Magus, seeing him.\n\n\"For how much?\"\n\n\"I got back what I gave and a small interest. Make me some Flemish\ninteriors, a lesson of anatomy, landscapes, and such like, and I'll buy\nthem of you,\" said Elie.\n\nFougeres would fain have taken old Magus in his arms; he regarded him as\na father. He went home with joy in his heart; the great painter Schinner\nwas mistaken after all! In that immense city of Paris there were some\nhearts that beat in unison with Pierre's; his talent was understood and\nappreciated. The poor fellow of twenty-seven had the innocence of a lad\nof sixteen. Another man, one of those distrustful, surly artists, would\nhave noticed the diabolical look on Elie's face and seen the twitching\nof the hairs of his beard, the irony of his moustache, and the movement\nof his shoulders which betrayed the satisfaction of Walter Scott's Jew\nin swindling a Christian.\n\nFougeres marched along the boulevard in a state of joy which gave to his\nhonest face an expression of pride. He was like a schoolboy protecting\na woman. He met Joseph Bridau, one of his comrades, and one of those\neccentric geniuses destined to fame and sorrow. Joseph Bridau, who had,\nto use his own expression, a few sous in his pocket, took Fougeres to\nthe Opera. But Fougeres didn't see the ballet, didn't hear the music; he\nwas imagining pictures, he was painting. He left Joseph in the middle\nof the evening, and ran home to make sketches by lamp-light. He invented\nthirty pictures, all reminiscence, and felt himself a man of genius. The\nnext day he bought colors, and canvases of various dimensions; he piled\nup bread and cheese on his table, he filled a water-pot with water,\nhe laid in a provision of wood for his stove; then, to use a studio\nexpression, he dug at his pictures. He hired several models and Magus\nlent him stuffs.\n\nAfter two months' seclusion the Breton had finished four pictures. Again\nhe asked counsel of Schinner, this time adding Bridau to the invitation.\nThe two painters saw in three of these pictures a servile imitation\nof Dutch landscapes and interiors by Metzu, in the fourth a copy of\nRembrandt's \"Lesson of Anatomy.\"\n\n\"Still imitating!\" said Schinner. \"Ah! Fougeres can't manage to be\noriginal.\"\n\n\"You ought to do something else than painting,\" said Bridau.\n\n\"What?\" asked Fougeres.\n\n\"Fling yourself into literature.\"\n\nFougeres lowered his head like a sheep when it rains. Then he asked and\nobtained certain useful advice, and retouched his pictures before taking\nthem to Elie Magus. Elie paid him twenty-five francs apiece. At that\nprice of course Fougeres earned nothing; neither did he lose, thanks to\nhis sober living. He made a few excursions to the boulevard to see what\nbecame of his pictures, and there he underwent a singular hallucination.\nHis neat, clean paintings, hard as tin and shiny as porcelain, were\ncovered with a sort of mist; they looked like old daubs. Magus was out,\nand Pierre could obtain no information on this phenomenon. He fancied\nsomething was wrong with his eyes.\n\nThe painter went back to his studio and made more pictures. After seven\nyears of continued toil Fougeres managed to compose and execute quite\npassable work. He did as well as any artist of the second class.\nElie bought and sold all the paintings of the poor Breton, who earned\nlaboriously about two thousand francs a year while he spent but twelve\nhundred.\n\nAt the Exhibition of 1829, Leon de Lora, Schinner, and Bridau, who all\nthree occupied a great position and were, in fact, at the head of the\nart movement, were filled with pity for the perseverance and the poverty\nof their old friend; and they caused to be admitted into the grand salon\nof the Exhibition, a picture by Fougeres. This picture, powerful in\ninterest but derived from Vigneron as to sentiment and from Dubufe's\nfirst manner as to execution, represented a young man in prison, whose\nhair was being cut around the nape of the neck. On one side was\na priest, on the other two women, one old, one young, in tears. A\nsheriff's clerk was reading aloud a document. On a wretched table was a\nmeal, untouched. The light came in through the bars of a window near\nthe ceiling. It was a picture fit to make the bourgeois shudder, and\nthe bourgeois shuddered. Fougeres had simply been inspired by the\nmasterpiece of Gerard Douw; he had turned the group of the \"Dropsical\nWoman\" toward the window, instead of presenting it full front. The\ncondemned man was substituted for the dying woman--same pallor, same\nglance, same appeal to God. Instead of the Dutch doctor, he had painted\nthe cold, official figure of the sheriff's clerk attired in black; but\nhe had added an old woman to the young one of Gerard Douw. The cruelly\nsimple and good-humored face of the executioner completed and dominated\nthe group. This plagiarism, very cleverly disguised, was not discovered.\nThe catalogue contained the following:--\n\n     510. Grassou de Fougeres (Pierre), rue de Navarin, 2.\n     Death-toilet of a Chouan, condemned to execution in 1809.\n\nThough wholly second-rate, the picture had immense success, for it\nrecalled the affair of the \"chauffeurs,\" of Mortagne. A crowd collected\nevery day before the now fashionable canvas; even Charles X. paused to\nlook at it. \"Madame,\" being told of the patient life of the poor Breton,\nbecame enthusiastic over him. The Duc d'Orleans asked the price of\nthe picture. The clergy told Madame la Dauphine that the subject was\nsuggestive of good thoughts; and there was, in truth, a most satisfying\nreligious tone about it. Monseigneur the Dauphin admired the dust on\nthe stone-floor,--a huge blunder, by the way, for Fougeres had painted\ngreenish tones suggestive of mildew along the base of the walls.\n\"Madame\" finally bought the picture for a thousand francs, and the\nDauphin ordered another like it. Charles X. gave the cross of the Legion\nof honor to this son of a peasant who had fought for the royal cause\nin 1799. (Joseph Bridau, the great painter, was not yet decorated.) The\nminister of the Interior ordered two church pictures of Fougeres.\n\nThis Salon of 1829 was to Pierre Grassou his whole fortune, fame,\nfuture, and life. Be original, invent, and you die by inches; copy,\nimitate, and you'll live. After this discovery of a gold mine, Grassou\nde Fougeres obtained his benefit of the fatal principle to which society\nowes the wretched mediocrities to whom are intrusted in these days the\nelection of leaders in all social classes; who proceed, naturally, to\nelect themselves and who wage a bitter war against all true talent. The\nprinciple of election applied indiscriminately is false, and France will\nsome day abandon it.\n\nNevertheless the modesty, simplicity, and genuine surprise of the good\nand gentle Fougeres silenced all envy and all recriminations. Besides,\nhe had on his side all of his clan who had succeeded, and all who\nexpected to succeed. Some persons, touched by the persistent energy of a\nman whom nothing had discouraged, talked of Domenichino and said:--\n\n\"Perseverance in the arts should be rewarded. Grassou hasn't stolen his\nsuccesses; he has delved for ten years, the poor dear man!\"\n\nThat exclamation of \"poor dear man!\" counted for half in the support\nand the congratulations which the painter received. Pity sets up\nmediocrities as envy pulls down great talents, and in equal numbers.\nThe newspapers, it is true, did not spare criticism, but the chevalier\nFougeres digested them as he had digested the counsel of his friends,\nwith angelic patience.\n\nPossessing, by this time, fifteen thousand francs, laboriously earned,\nhe furnished an apartment and studio in the rue de Navarin, and painted\nthe picture ordered by Monseigneur the Dauphin, also the two church\npictures, and delivered them at the time agreed on, with a punctuality\nthat was very discomforting to the exchequer of the ministry, accustomed\nto a different course of action. But--admire the good fortune of men who\nare methodical--if Grassou, belated with his work, had been caught by\nthe revolution of July he would not have got his money.\n\nBy the time he was thirty-seven Fougeres had manufactured for Elie Magus\nsome two hundred pictures, all of them utterly unknown, by the help of\nwhich he had attained to that satisfying manner, that point of execution\nbefore which the true artist shrugs his shoulders and the bourgeoisie\nworships. Fougeres was dear to friends for rectitude of ideas, for\nsteadiness of sentiment, absolute kindliness, and great loyalty; though\nthey had no esteem for his palette, they loved the man who held it.\n\n\"What a misfortune it is that Fougeres has the vice of painting!\" said\nhis comrades.\n\nBut for all this, Grassou gave excellent counsel, like those\nfeuilletonists incapable of writing a book who know very well where a\nbook is wanting. There was this difference, however, between literary\ncritics and Fougeres; he was eminently sensitive to beauties; he felt\nthem, he acknowledged them, and his advice was instinct with a spirit\nof justice that made the justness of his remarks acceptable. After\nthe revolution of July, Fougeres sent about ten pictures a year to the\nSalon, of which the jury admitted four or five. He lived with the most\nrigid economy, his household being managed solely by an old charwoman.\nFor all amusement he visited his friends, he went to see works of art,\nhe allowed himself a few little trips about France, and he planned to go\nto Switzerland in search of inspiration. This detestable artist was an\nexcellent citizen; he mounted guard duly, went to reviews, and paid his\nrent and provision-bills with bourgeois punctuality.\n\nHaving lived all his life in toil and poverty, he had never had the time\nto love. Poor and a bachelor, until now he did not desire to complicate\nhis simple life. Incapable of devising any means of increasing his\nlittle fortune, he carried, every three months, to his notary, Cardot,\nhis quarterly earnings and economies. When the notary had received\nabout three thousand francs he invested them in some first mortgage, the\ninterest of which he drew himself and added to the quarterly payments\nmade to him by Fougeres. The painter was awaiting the fortunate moment\nwhen his property thus laid by would give him the imposing income of two\nthousand francs, to allow himself the otium cum dignitate of the\nartist and paint pictures; but oh! what pictures! true pictures! each a\nfinished picture! chouette, Koxnoff, chocnosoff! His future, his dreams\nof happiness, the superlative of his hopes--do you know what it was?\nTo enter the Institute and obtain the grade of officer of the Legion\nof honor; to side down beside Schinner and Leon de Lora, to reach the\nAcademy before Bridau, to wear a rosette in his buttonhole! What a\ndream! It is only commonplace men who think of everything.\n\nHearing the sound of several steps on the staircase, Fougeres rubbed up\nhis hair, buttoned his jacket of bottle-green velveteen, and was not a\nlittle amazed to see, entering his doorway, a simpleton face vulgarly\ncalled in studio slang a \"melon.\" This fruit surmounted a pumpkin,\nclothed in blue cloth adorned with a bunch of tintinnabulating baubles.\nThe melon puffed like a walrus; the pumpkin advanced on turnips,\nimproperly called legs. A true painter would have turned the little\nbottle-vendor off at once, assuring him that he didn't paint vegetables.\nThis painter looked at his client without a smile, for Monsieur Vervelle\nwore a three-thousand-franc diamond in the bosom of his shirt.\n\nFougeres glanced at Magus and said: \"There's fat in it!\" using a slang\nterm then much in vogue in the studios.\n\nHearing those words Monsieur Vervelle frowned. The worthy bourgeois drew\nafter him another complication of vegetables in the persons of his wife\nand daughter. The wife had a fine veneer of mahogany on her face, and\nin figure she resembled a cocoa-nut, surmounted by a head and tied in\naround the waist. She pivoted on her legs, which were tap-rooted,\nand her gown was yellow with black stripes. She proudly exhibited\nunutterable mittens on a puffy pair of hands; the plumes of a\nfirst-class funeral floated on an over-flowing bonnet; laces adorned\nher shoulders, as round behind as they were before; consequently, the\nspherical form of the cocoa-nut was perfect. Her feet, of a kind that\npainters call abatis, rose above the varnished leather of the shoes in a\nswelling that was some inches high. How the feet were ever got into the\nshoes, no one knows.\n\nFollowing these vegetable parents was a young asparagus, who presented\na tiny head with smoothly banded hair of the yellow-carroty tone that a\nRoman adores, long, stringy arms, a fairly white skin with reddish spots\nupon it, large innocent eyes, and white lashes, scarcely any brows, a\nleghorn bonnet bound with white satin and adorned with two honest bows\nof the same satin, hands virtuously red, and the feet of her mother. The\nfaces of these three beings wore, as they looked round the studio, an\nair of happiness which bespoke in them a respectable enthusiasm for Art.\n\n\"So it is you, monsieur, who are going to take our likenesses?\" said the\nfather, assuming a jaunty air.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Grassou.\n\n\"Vervelle, he has the cross!\" whispered the wife to the husband while\nthe painter's back was turned.\n\n\"Should I be likely to have our portraits painted by an artist who\nwasn't decorated?\" returned the former bottle-dealer.\n\nElie Magus here bowed to the Vervelle family and went away. Grassou\naccompanied him to the landing.\n\n\"There's no one but you who would fish up such whales.\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs of 'dot'!\"\n\n\"Yes, but what a family!\"\n\n\"Three hundred thousand francs of expectations, a house in the rue\nBoucherat, and a country-house at Ville d'Avray!\"\n\n\"Bottles and corks! bottles and corks!\" said the painter; \"they set my\nteeth on edge.\"\n\n\"Safe from want for the rest of your days,\" said Elie Magus as he\ndeparted.\n\nThat idea entered the head of Pierre Grassou as the daylight had burst\ninto his garret that morning.\n\nWhile he posed the father of the young person, he thought the\nbottle-dealer had a good countenance, and he admired the face full\nof violent tones. The mother and daughter hovered about the easel,\nmarvelling at all his preparations; they evidently thought him a\ndemigod. This visible admiration pleased Fougeres. The golden calf threw\nupon the family its fantastic reflections.\n\n\"You must earn lots of money; but of course you don't spend it as you\nget it,\" said the mother.\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied the painter; \"I don't spend it; I have not the\nmeans to amuse myself. My notary invests my money; he knows what I have;\nas soon as I have taken him the money I never think of it again.\"\n\n\"I've always been told,\" cried old Vervelle, \"that artists were baskets\nwith holes in them.\"\n\n\"Who is your notary--if it is not indiscreet to ask?\" said Madame\nVervelle.\n\n\"A good fellow, all round,\" replied Grassou. \"His name is Cardot.\"\n\n\"Well, well! if that isn't a joke!\" exclaimed Vervelle. \"Cardot is our\nnotary too.\"\n\n\"Take care! don't move,\" said the painter.\n\n\"Do pray hold still, Antenor,\" said the wife. \"If you move about you'll\nmake monsieur miss; you should just see him working, and then you'd\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Oh! why didn't you have me taught the arts?\" said Mademoiselle Vervelle\nto her parents.\n\n\"Virginie,\" said her mother, \"a young person ought not to learn certain\nthings. When you are married--well, till then, keep quiet.\"\n\nDuring this first sitting the Vervelle family became almost intimate\nwith the worthy artist. They were to come again two days later. As they\nwent away the father told Virginie to walk in front; but in spite of\nthis separation, she overheard the following words, which naturally\nawakened her curiosity.\n\n\"Decorated--thirty-seven years old--an artist who gets orders--puts his\nmoney with our notary. We'll consult Cardot. Hein! Madame de Fougeres!\nnot a bad name--doesn't look like a bad man either! One might prefer a\nmerchant; but before a merchant retires from business one can never know\nwhat one's daughter may come to; whereas an economical artist--and then\nyou know we love Art--Well, we'll see!\"\n\nWhile the Vervelle family discussed Pierre Grassou, Pierre Grassou\ndiscussed in his own mind the Vervelle family. He found it impossible to\nstay peacefully in his studio, so he took a walk on the boulevard, and\nlooked at all the red-haired women who passed him. He made a series of\nthe oddest reasonings to himself: gold was the handsomest of metals; a\ntawny yellow represented gold; the Romans were fond of red-haired women,\nand he turned Roman, etc. After two years of marriage what man would\never care about the color of his wife's hair? Beauty fades,--but\nugliness remains! Money is one-half of all happiness. That night when he\nwent to bed the painter had come to think Virginie Vervelle charming.\n\nWhen the three Vervelles arrived on the day of the second sitting the\nartist received them with smiles. The rascal had shaved and put on clean\nlinen; he had also arranged his hair in a pleasing manner, and chosen\na very becoming pair of trousers and red leather slippers with pointed\ntoes. The family replied with smiles as flattering as those of the\nartist. Virginie became the color of her hair, lowered her eyes, and\nturned aside her head to look at the sketches. Pierre Grassou thought\nthese little affectations charming, Virginie had such grace; happily she\ndidn't look like her father or her mother; but whom did she look like?\n\nDuring this sitting there were little skirmishes between the family\nand the painter, who had the audacity to call pere Vervelle witty. This\nflattery brought the family on the double-quick to the heart of the\nartist; he gave a drawing to the daughter, and a sketch to the mother.\n\n\"What! for nothing?\" they said.\n\nPierre Grassou could not help smiling.\n\n\"You shouldn't give away your pictures in that way; they are money,\"\nsaid old Vervelle.\n\nAt the third sitting pere Vervelle mentioned a fine gallery of pictures\nwhich he had in his country-house at Ville d'Avray--Rubens, Gerard Douw,\nMieris, Terburg, Rembrandt, Titian, Paul Potter, etc.\n\n\"Monsieur Vervelle has been very extravagant,\" said Madame Vervelle,\nostentatiously. \"He has over one hundred thousand francs' worth of\npictures.\"\n\n\"I love Art,\" said the former bottle-dealer.\n\nWhen Madame Vervelle's portrait was begun that of her husband was nearly\nfinished, and the enthusiasm of the family knew no bounds. The notary\nhad spoken in the highest praise of the painter. Pierre Grassou was, he\nsaid, one of the most honest fellows on earth; he had laid by thirty-six\nthousand francs; his days of poverty were over; he now saved about ten\nthousand francs a year and capitalized the interest; in short, he was\nincapable of making a woman unhappy. This last remark had enormous\nweight in the scales. Vervelle's friends now heard of nothing but the\ncelebrated painter Fougeres.\n\nThe day on which Fougeres began the portrait of Mademoiselle Virginie,\nhe was virtually son-in-law to the Vervelle family. The three Vervelles\nbloomed out in this studio, which they were now accustomed to consider\nas one of their residences; there was to them an inexplicable attraction\nin this clean, neat, pretty, and artistic abode. Abyssus abyssum, the\ncommonplace attracts the commonplace. Toward the end of the sitting the\nstairway shook, the door was violently thrust open by Joseph Bridau; he\ncame like a whirlwind, his hair flying. He showed his grand haggard face\nas he looked about him, casting everywhere the lightning of his glance;\nthen he walked round the whole studio, and returned abruptly to Grassou,\npulling his coat together over the gastric region, and endeavouring, but\nin vain, to button it, the button mould having escaped from its capsule\nof cloth.\n\n\"Wood is dear,\" he said to Grassou.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"The British are after me\" (slang term for creditors) \"Gracious! do you\npaint such things as that?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\"\n\n\"Ah! to be sure, yes.\"\n\nThe Vervelle family, extremely shocked by this extraordinary apparition,\npassed from its ordinary red to a cherry-red, two shades deeper.\n\n\"Brings in, hey?\" continued Joseph. \"Any shot in your locker?\"\n\n\"How much do you want?\"\n\n\"Five hundred. I've got one of those bull-dog dealers after me, and if\nthe fellow once gets his teeth in he won't let go while there's a bit of\nme left. What a crew!\"\n\n\"I'll write you a line for my notary.\"\n\n\"Have you got a notary?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That explains to me why you still make cheeks with pink tones like a\nperfumer's sign.\"\n\nGrassou could not help coloring, for Virginie was sitting.\n\n\"Take Nature as you find her,\" said the great painter, going on with his\nlecture. \"Mademoiselle is red-haired. Well, is that a sin? All things\nare magnificent in painting. Put some vermillion on your palette, and\nwarm up those cheeks; touch in those little brown spots; come, butter it\nwell in. Do you pretend to have more sense than Nature?\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Fougeres, \"take my place while I go and write that\nnote.\"\n\nVervelle rolled to the table and whispered in Grassou's ear:--\n\n\"Won't that country lout spoilt it?\"\n\n\"If he would only paint the portrait of your Virginie it would be worth\na thousand times more than mine,\" replied Fougeres, vehemently.\n\nHearing that reply the bourgeois beat a quiet retreat to his wife, who\nwas stupefied by the invasion of this ferocious animal, and very uneasy\nat his co-operation in her daughter's portrait.\n\n\"Here, follow these indications,\" said Bridau, returning the palette,\nand taking the note. \"I won't thank you. I can go back now to d'Arthez'\nchateau, where I am doing a dining-room, and Leon de Lora the tops of\nthe doors--masterpieces! Come and see us.\"\n\nAnd off he went without taking leave, having had enough of looking at\nVirginie.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" asked Madame Vervelle.\n\n\"A great artist,\" answered Grassou.\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"Are you quite sure,\" said Virginie, \"that he has done no harm to my\nportrait? He frightened me.\"\n\n\"He has only done it good,\" replied Grassou.\n\n\"Well, if he is a great artist, I prefer a great artist like you,\" said\nMadame Vervelle.\n\nThe ways of genius had ruffled up these orderly bourgeois.\n\nThe phase of autumn so pleasantly named \"Saint Martin's summer\" was\njust beginning. With the timidity of a neophyte in presence of a man of\ngenius, Vervelle risked giving Fougeres an invitation to come out to\nhis country-house on the following Sunday. He knew, he said, how little\nattraction a plain bourgeois family could offer to an artist.\n\n\"You artists,\" he continued, \"want emotions, great scenes, and witty\ntalk; but you'll find good wines, and I rely on my collection of\npictures to compensate an artist like you for the bore of dining with\nmere merchants.\"\n\nThis form of idolatry, which stroked his innocent self-love, was\ncharming to our poor Pierre Grassou, so little accustomed to such\ncompliments. The honest artist, that atrocious mediocrity, that heart\nof gold, that loyal soul, that stupid draughtsman, that worthy fellow,\ndecorated by royalty itself with the Legion of honor, put himself under\narms to go out to Ville d'Avray and enjoy the last fine days of the\nyear. The painter went modestly by public conveyance, and he could not\nbut admire the beautiful villa of the bottle-dealer, standing in a park\nof five acres at the summit of Ville d'Avray, commanding a noble view\nof the landscape. Marry Virginie, and have that beautiful villa some day\nfor his own!\n\nHe was received by the Vervelles with an enthusiasm, a joy, a\nkindliness, a frank bourgeois absurdity which confounded him. It was\nindeed a day of triumph. The prospective son-in-law was marched about\nthe grounds on the nankeen-colored paths, all raked as they should be\nfor the steps of so great a man. The trees themselves looked brushed and\ncombed, and the lawns had just been mown. The pure country air wafted\nto the nostrils a most enticing smell of cooking. All things about the\nmansion seemed to say:\n\n\"We have a great artist among us.\"\n\nLittle old Vervelle himself rolled like an apple through his park, the\ndaughter meandered like an eel, the mother followed with dignified step.\nThese three beings never let go for one moment of Pierre Grassou\nfor seven hours. After dinner, the length of which equalled its\nmagnificence, Monsieur and Madame Vervelle reached the moment of their\ngrand theatrical effect,--the opening of the picture gallery illuminated\nby lamps, the reflections of which were managed with the utmost care.\nThree neighbours, also retired merchants, an old uncle (from whom were\nexpectations), an elderly Demoiselle Vervelle, and a number of other\nguests invited to be present at this ovation to a great artist followed\nGrassou into the picture gallery, all curious to hear his opinion of the\nfamous collection of pere Vervelle, who was fond of oppressing them with\nthe fabulous value of his paintings. The bottle-merchant seemed to have\nthe idea of competing with King Louis-Philippe and the galleries of\nVersailles.\n\nThe pictures, magnificently framed, each bore labels on which was read\nin black letters on a gold ground:\n\n               Rubens\n     Dance of fauns and nymphs\n\n                         Rembrandt\n     Interior of a dissecting room. The physician van Tromp\n             instructing his pupils.\n\nIn all, there were one hundred and fifty pictures, varnished and dusted.\nSome were covered with green baize curtains which were not undrawn in\npresence of young ladies.\n\nPierre Grassou stood with arms pendent, gaping mouth, and no word upon\nhis lips as he recognized half his own pictures in these works of art.\nHe was Rubens, he was Rembrandt, Mieris, Metzu, Paul Potter, Gerard\nDouw! He was twenty great masters all by himself.\n\n\"What is the matter? You've turned pale!\"\n\n\"Daughter, a glass of water! quick!\" cried Madame Vervelle. The painter\ntook pere Vervelle by the button of his coat and led him to a corner on\npretence of looking at a Murillo. Spanish pictures were then the rage.\n\n\"You bought your pictures from Elie Magus?\"\n\n\"Yes, all originals.\"\n\n\"Between ourselves, tell me what he made you pay for those I shall point\nout to you.\"\n\nTogether they walked round the gallery. The guests were amazed at the\ngravity in which the artist proceeded, in company with the host, to\nexamine each picture.\n\n\"Three thousand francs,\" said Vervelle in a whisper, as they reached the\nlast, \"but I tell everybody forty thousand.\"\n\n\"Forty thousand for a Titian!\" said the artist, aloud. \"Why, it is\nnothing at all!\"\n\n\"Didn't I tell you,\" said Vervelle, \"that I had three hundred thousand\nfrancs' worth of pictures?\"\n\n\"I painted those pictures,\" said Pierre Grassou in Vervelle's ear, \"and\nI sold them one by one to Elie Magus for less than ten thousand francs\nthe whole lot.\"\n\n\"Prove it to me,\" said the bottle-dealer, \"and I double my daughter's\n'dot,' for if it is so, you are Rubens, Rembrandt, Titian, Gerard Douw!\"\n\n\"And Magus is a famous picture-dealer!\" said the painter, who now saw\nthe meaning of the misty and aged look imparted to his pictures in\nElie's shop, and the utility of the subjects the picture-dealer had\nrequired of him.\n\nFar from losing the esteem of his admiring bottle-merchant, Monsieur\nde Fougeres (for so the family persisted in calling Pierre Grassou)\nadvanced so much that when the portraits were finished he presented them\ngratuitously to his father-in-law, his mother-in-law and his wife.\n\nAt the present day, Pierre Grassou, who never misses exhibiting at the\nSalon, passes in bourgeois regions for a fine portrait-painter. He earns\nsome twenty thousand francs a year and spoils a thousand francs' worth\nof canvas. His wife has six thousand francs a year in dowry, and he\nlives with his father-in-law. The Vervelles and the Grassous, who agree\ndelightfully, keep a carriage, and are the happiest people on earth.\nPierre Grassou never emerges from the bourgeois circle, in which he\nis considered one of the greatest artists of the period. Not a family\nportrait is painted between the barrier du Trone and the rue du Temple\nthat is not done by this great painter; none of them costs less than\nfive hundred francs. The great reason which the bourgeois families have\nfor employing him is this:--\n\n\"Say what you will of him, he lays by twenty thousand francs a year with\nhis notary.\"\n\nAs Grassou took a creditable part on the occasion of the riots of May\n12th he was appointed an officer of the Legion of honor. He is a major\nin the National Guard. The Museum of Versailles felt it incumbent to\norder a battle-piece of so excellent a citizen, who thereupon walked\nabout Paris to meet his old comrades and have the happiness of saying to\nthem:--\n\n\"The King has given me an order for the Museum of Versailles.\"\n\nMadame de Fougeres adores her husband, to whom she has presented two\nchildren. This painter, a good father and a good husband, is unable to\neradicate from his heart a fatal thought, namely, that artists laugh at\nhis work; that his name is a term of contempt in the studios; and that\nthe feuilletons take no notice of his pictures. But he still works on;\nhe aims for the Academy, where, undoubtedly, he will enter. And--oh!\nvengeance which dilates his heart!--he buys the pictures of celebrated\nartists who are pinched for means, and he substitutes these true works\nof arts that are not his own for the wretched daubs in the collection at\nVille d'Avray.\n\nThere are many mediocrities more aggressive and more mischievous than\nthat of Pierre Grassou, who is, moreover, anonymously benevolent and\ntruly obliging.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Bridau, Joseph\n       The Purse\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Start in Life\n       Modeste Mignon\n       Another Study of Woman\n       Letters of Two Brides\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Member for Arcis\n\n     Cardot (Parisian notary)\n       The Muse of the Department\n       A Man of Business\n       Jealousies of a Country Town\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Grassou, Pierre\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Lora, Leon de\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Start in Life\n       Honorine\n       Cousin Betty\n       Beatrix\n\n     Magus, Elie\n       The Vendetta\n       A Marriage Settlement\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Schinner, Hippolyte\n       The Purse\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Start in Life\n       Albert Savarus\n       The Government Clerks\n       Modeste Mignon\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pierre Grassou, by Honore de Balzac"}

After graduating from Midwood High School in 1954 Livingston attends Columbia University and Castellano Radcliffe College, and both enter Harvard Medical School in 1958; he wants to become a psychiatrist, and she is drawn to pediatrics. Others include Rhodes Scholar Bennett Landsmann, the wealthy black adoptee of Jewish parents; former Jesuit Hank Dwyer; former Miss Oregon Grete Anderson; and top students Peter Wyman and Seth Lazarus.\nThey survive the immense stress that drives some to suicide, and after graduation leave for internships and residencies. Livingston becomes an author and finds at the New York State Psychiatric Institute that psychiatrists can be as disturbed as their patients; Castellano's unhappy marriage to an Army officer causes both to have affairs; Wyman aggressively seeks fame as a researcher at Harvard; Landsmann at YaleâNew Haven Hospital finds that some during the Civil Rights era dislike his two heritages; Anderson's beauty attracts men that she has difficulty forming relationships with; and Lazarus in Chicago begins to commit mercy killings of patients in great pain who want to die.\nBy their late 30s Livingston and Castellano, after many other relationships for both, marry and become first-time parents in New York City; Wyman is at a Silicon Valley biotechnology company; Anderson is a transplant surgeon in Houston; Dwyer opens a successful IVF clinic in Hawaii; and Landsmann, a lawyer after a spinal injury ends his surgical career, defends Lazarus in a trial for murder.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK DOCTOR ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                DOCTOR\n\n                          BY MURRAY LEINSTER\n\n                         Illustrated by FINLAY\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                    Galaxy Magazine February 1961.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n                   Suddenly the biggest thing in the\n                    universe was the very tiniest.\n\n\nThere were suns, which were nearby, and there were stars which were\nso far away that no way of telling their distance had any meaning.\nThe suns had planets, most of which did not matter, but the ones that\ndid count had seas and continents, and the continents had cities and\nhighways and spaceports. And people.\n\nThe people paid no attention to their insignificance. They built ships\nwhich went through emptiness beyond imagining, and they landed upon\nplanets and rebuilt them to their own liking. Suns flamed terribly,\nrenting their impertinence, and storms swept across the planets\nthey preÃ«mpted, but the people built more strongly and were secure.\nEverything in the universe was bigger or stronger than the people,\nbut they ignored the fact. They went about the businesses they had\ncontrived for themselves.\n\nThey were not afraid of anything until somewhere on a certain small\nplanet an infinitesimal single molecule changed itself.\n\nIt was one molecule among unthinkably many, upon one planet of one\nsolar system among uncountable star clusters. It was not exactly alive,\nbut it acted as if it were, in which it was like all the important\nmatter of the cosmos. It was actually a combination of two complicated\nsubstances not too firmly joined together. When one of the parts\nchanged, it became a new molecule. But, like the original one, it was\nstill capable of a process called autocatalysis. It practiced that\nprocess and catalyzed other molecules into existence, which in each\ncase were duplicates of itself. Then mankind had to take notice, though\nit ignored flaming suns and monstrous storms and emptiness past belief.\n\nMen called the new molecule a virus and gave it a name. They called it\nand its duplicates \"chlorophage.\" And chlorophage was, to people, the\nmost terrifying thing in the universe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a strictly temporary orbit around the planet Altaira, the _Star\nQueen_ floated, while lift-ships brought passengers and cargo up to\nit. The ship was too large to be landed economically at an unimportant\nspaceport like Altaira. It was a very modern ship and it made the\nRegulus-to-Cassim run, which is five hundred light-years, in only fifty\ndays of Earthtime.\n\nNow the lift-ships were busy. There was an unusual number of passengers\nto board the _Star Queen_ at Altaira and an unusual number of them were\nwomen and children. The children tended to pudginess and the women had\nthe dieted look of the wives of well-to-do men. Most of them looked\nred-eyed, as if they had been crying.\n\nOne by one the lift-ships hooked onto the airlock of the _Star Queen_\nand delivered passengers and cargo to the ship. Presently the last of\nthem was hooked on, and the last batch of passengers came through to\nthe liner, and the ship's doctor watched them stream past him.\n\nHis air was negligent, but he was actually impatient. Like most\ndoctors, Nordenfeld approved of lean children and wiry women. They had\nfewer things wrong with them and they responded better to treatment.\nWell, he was the doctor of the _Star Queen_ and he had much authority.\nHe'd exerted it back on Regulus to insist that a shipment of botanical\nspecimens for Cassim travel in quarantine--to be exact, in the ship's\npractically unused hospital compartment--and he was prepared to\nexercise authority over the passengers.\n\nHe had a sheaf of health slips from the examiners on the ground below.\nThere was one slip for each passenger. It certified that so-and-so had\nbeen examined and could safely be admitted to the _Star Queen's_ air,\nher four restaurants, her two swimming pools, her recreation areas and\nthe six levels of passenger cabins the ship contained.\n\nHe impatiently watched the people go by. Health slips or no health\nslips, he looked them over. A characteristic gait or a typical\ncomplexion tint, or even a certain lack of hair luster, could tell him\nthings that ground physicians might miss. In such a case the passenger\nwould go back down again. It was not desirable to have deaths on a\nliner in space. Of course nobody was ever refused passage because of\nchlorophage. If it were ever discovered, the discovery would already be\ntoo late. But the health regulations for space travel were very, very\nstrict.\n\nHe looked twice at a young woman as she passed. Despite applied\ncomplexion, there was a trace of waxiness in her skin. Nordenfeld had\nnever actually seen a case of chlorophage. No doctor alive ever had.\nThe best authorities were those who'd been in Patrol ships during the\nquarantine of Kamerun when chlorophage was loose on that planet. They'd\nseen beamed-up pictures of patients, but not patients themselves. The\nPatrol ships stayed in orbit while the planet died. Most doctors, and\nNordenfeld was among them, had only seen pictures of the screens which\nshowed the patients.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked sharply at the young woman. Then he glanced at her hands.\nThey were normal. The young woman went on, unaware that for the\nfraction of an instant there had been the possibility of the landing of\nthe _Star Queen_ on Altaira, and the destruction of her space drive,\nand the establishment of a quarantine which, if justified, would mean\nthat nobody could ever leave Altaira again, but must wait there to die.\nWhich would not be a long wait.\n\nA fat man puffed past. The gravity on Altaira was some five per cent\nunder ship-normal and he felt the difference at once. But the veins at\nhis temples were ungorged. Nordenfeld let him go by.\n\nThere appeared a white-haired, space-tanned man with a briefcase under\nhis arm. He saw Nordenfeld and lifted a hand in greeting. The doctor\nknew him. He stepped aside from the passengers and stood there. His\nname was Jensen, and he represented a fund which invested the surplus\nmoney of insurance companies. He traveled a great deal to check on the\nbusiness interests of that organization.\n\nThe doctor grunted, \"What're you doing here? I thought you'd be on the\nfar side of the cluster.\"\n\n\"Oh, I get about,\" said Jensen. His manner was not quite normal. He was\ntense. \"I got here two weeks ago on a Q-and-C tramp from Regulus. We\nwere a ship load of salt meat. There's romance for you! Salt meat by\nthe spaceship load!\"\n\nThe doctor grunted again. All sorts of things moved through space,\nnaturally. The _Star Queen_ carried a botanical collection for a museum\nand pig-beryllium and furs and enzymes and a list of items no man could\nremember. He watched the passengers go by, automatically counting them\nagainst the number of health slips in his hand.\n\n\"Lots of passengers this trip,\" said Jensen.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, watching a man with a limp. \"Why?\"\n\nJensen shrugged and did not answer. He was uneasy, the doctor noted.\nHe and Jensen were as much unlike as two men could very well be, but\nJensen was good company. A ship's doctor does not have much congenial\nsociety.\n\nThe file of passengers ended abruptly. There was no one in the _Star\nQueen's_ airlock, but the \"Connected\" lights still burned and the\ndoctor could look through into the small lift-ship from the planet down\nbelow. He frowned. He fingered the sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Unless I missed count,\" he said annoyedly, \"there's supposed to be one\nmore passenger. I don't see--\"\n\nA door opened far back in the lift-ship. A small figure appeared. It\nwas a little girl perhaps ten years old. She was very neatly dressed,\nthough not quite the way a mother would have done it. She wore the\ncarefully composed expression of a child with no adult in charge of\nher. She walked precisely from the lift-ship into the _Star Queen's_\nlock. The opening closed briskly behind her. There was the rumbling of\nseals making themselves tight. The lights flickered for \"Disconnect\"\nand then \"All Clear.\" They went out, and the lift-ship had pulled away\nfrom the _Star Queen_.\n\n\"There's my missing passenger,\" said the doctor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe child looked soberly about. She saw him. \"Excuse me,\" she said very\npolitely. \"Is this the way I'm supposed to go?\"\n\n\"Through that door,\" said the doctor gruffly.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the little girl. She followed his direction. She\nvanished through the door. It closed.\n\nThere came a deep, droning sound, which was the interplanetary drive\nof the _Star Queen_, building up that directional stress in space\nwhich had seemed such a triumph when it was first contrived. The ship\nswung gently. It would be turning out from orbit around Altaira. It\nswung again. The doctor knew that its astrogators were feeling for the\nincredibly exact pointing of its nose toward the next port which modern\ncommercial ship operation required. An error of fractional seconds of\narc would mean valuable time lost in making port some ten light-years\nof distance away. The drive droned and droned, building up velocity\nwhile the ship's aiming was refined and re-refined.\n\nThe drive cut off abruptly. Jensen turned white.\n\nThe doctor said impatiently, \"There's nothing wrong. Probably a message\nor a report should have been beamed down to the planet and somebody\nforgot. We'll go on in a minute.\"\n\nBut Jensen stood frozen. He was very pale. The interplanetary drive\nstayed off. Thirty seconds. A minute. Jensen swallowed audibly. Two\nminutes. Three.\n\nThe steady, monotonous drone began again. It continued interminably, as\nif while it was off the ship's head had swung wide of its destination\nand the whole business of lining up for a jump in overdrive had to be\ndone all over again.\n\nThen there came that \"Ping-g-g-g!\" and the sensation of spiral fall\nwhich meant overdrive. The droning ceased.\n\nJensen breathed again. The ship's doctor looked at him sharply. Jensen\nhad been taut. Now the tensions had left his body, but he looked as\nif he were going to shiver. Instead, he mopped a suddenly streaming\nforehead.\n\n\"I think,\" said Jensen in a strange voice, \"that I'll have a drink. Or\nseveral. Will you join me?\"\n\nNordenfeld searched his face. A ship's doctor has many duties in\nspace. Passengers can have many things wrong with them, and in the\nabsolute isolation of overdrive they can be remarkably affected by each\nother.\n\n\"I'll be at the fourth-level bar in twenty minutes,\" said Nordenfeld.\n\"Can you wait that long?\"\n\n\"I probably won't wait to have a drink,\" said Jensen. \"But I'll be\nthere.\"\n\nThe doctor nodded curtly. He went away. He made no guesses, though he'd\njust observed the new passengers carefully and was fully aware of the\nstrict health regulations that affect space travel. As a physician he\nknew that the most deadly thing in the universe was chlorophage and\nthat the planet Kamerun was only one solar system away. It had been\na stop for the _Star Queen_ until four years ago. He puzzled over\nJensen's tenseness and the relief he'd displayed when the overdrive\nfield came on. But he didn't guess. Chlorophage didn't enter his mind.\n\nNot until later.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw the little girl who'd come out of the airlock last of all the\npassengers. She sat on a sofa as if someone had told her to wait there\nuntil something or other was arranged. Doctor Nordenfeld barely glanced\nat her. He'd known Jensen for a considerable time. Jensen had been\na passenger on the _Star Queen_ half a dozen times, and he shouldn't\nhave been upset by the temporary stoppage of an interplanetary drive.\nNordenfeld divided people into two classes, those who were not and\nthose who were worth talking to. There weren't many of the latter.\nJensen was.\n\nHe filed away the health slips. Then, thinking of Jensen's pallor,\nhe asked what had happened to make the _Star Queen_ interrupt her\nslow-speed drive away from orbit around Altaira.\n\nThe purser told him. But the purser was fussily concerned because there\nwere so many extra passengers from Altaira. He might not be able to\ntake on the expected number of passengers at the next stop-over point.\nIt would be bad business to have to refuse passengers! It would give\nthe space line a bad name.\n\nThen the air officer stopped Nordenfeld as he was about to join Jensen\nin the fourth-level bar. It was time for a medical inspection of the\nquarter-acre of Banthyan jungle which purified and renewed the air\nof the ship. Nordenfeld was expected to check the complex ecological\nsystem of the air room. Specifically, he was expected to look for and\nidentify any patches of colorlessness appearing on the foliage of the\njungle plants the _Star Queen_ carried through space.\n\nThe air officer was discreet and Nordenfeld was silent about the\nultimate reason for the inspection. Nobody liked to think about it. But\nif a particular kind of bleaching appeared, as if the chlorophyll of\nthe leaves were being devoured by something too small to be seen by an\noptical microscope--why, that would be chlorophage. It would also be a\ndeath sentence for the _Star Queen_ and everybody in her.\n\nBut the jungle passed medical inspection. The plants grew lushly in\nsoil which periodically was flushed with hydroponic solution and\nthen drained away again. The UV lamps were properly distributed and\nthe different quarters of the air room were alternately lighted and\ndarkened. And there were no colorless patches. A steady wind blew\nthrough the air room and had its excess moisture and unpleasing smells\nwrung out before it recirculated through the ship. Doctor Nordenfeld\nauthorized the trimming of some liana-like growths which were\ndeveloping woody tissue at the expense of leaves.\n\nThe air officer also told him about the reason for the turning off of\nthe interplanetary drive. He considered it a very curious happening.\n\nThe doctor left the air room and passed the place where the little\ngirl--the last passenger to board the _Star Queen_--waited patiently\nfor somebody to arrange something. Doctor Nordenfeld took a lift to the\nfourth level and went into the bar where Jensen should be waiting.\n\nHe was. He had an empty glass before him. Nordenfeld sat down and\ndialed for a drink. He had an indefinite feeling that something was\nwrong, but he couldn't put his finger on it. There are always things\ngoing wrong for a ship's doctor, though. There are so many demands on\nhis patience that he is usually short of it.\n\nJensen watched him sip at his drink.\n\n\"A bad day?\" he asked. He'd gotten over his own tension.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld shrugged, but his scowl deepened. \"There are a lot of new\npassengers.\" He realized that he was trying to explain his feelings to\nhimself. \"They'll come to me feeling miserable. I have to tell each one\nthat if they feel heavy and depressed, it may be the gravity-constant\nof the ship, which is greater than their home planet. If they feel\nlight-headed and giddy, it may be because the gravity-constant of\nthe ship is less than they're used to. But it doesn't make them feel\nbetter, so they come back for a second assurance. I'll be overwhelmed\nwith such complaints within two hours.\"\n\nJensen waited. Then he said casually--too casually, \"Does anybody ever\nsuspect chlorophage?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nordenfeld shortly.\n\nJensen fidgeted. He sipped. Then he said, \"What's the news from\nKamerun, anyhow?\"\n\n\"There isn't any,\" said Nordenfeld. \"Naturally! Why ask?\"\n\n\"I just wondered,\" said Jensen. After a moment: \"What was the last\nnews?\"\n\n\"There hasn't been a message from Kamerun in two years,\" said\nNordenfeld curtly. \"There's no sign of anything green anywhere on the\nplanet. It's considered to be--uninhabited.\"\n\nJensen licked his lips. \"That's what I understood. Yes.\"\n\nNordenfeld drank half his drink and said unpleasantly, \"There were\nthirty million people on Kamerun when the chlorophage appeared. At\nfirst it was apparently a virus which fed on the chlorophyll of\nplants. They died. Then it was discovered that it could also feed on\nhemoglobin, which is chemically close to chlorophyll. Hemoglobin is the\nred coloring matter of the blood. When the virus consumed it, people\nbegan to die. Kamerun doctors found that the chlorophage virus was\ntransmitted by contact, by inhalation, by ingestion. It traveled as\ndust particles and on the feet of insects, and it was in drinking water\nand the air one breathed. The doctors on Kamerun warned spaceships\noff and the Patrol put a quarantine fleet in orbit around it to keep\nanybody from leaving. And nobody left. And everybody died. _And_ so did\nevery living thing that had chlorophyll in its leaves or hemoglobin in\nits blood, or that needed plant or animal tissues to feed on. There's\nnot a person left alive on Kamerun, nor an animal or bird or insect,\nnor a fish nor a tree, or plant or weed or blade of grass. There's no\nlonger a quarantine fleet there. Nobody'll go there and there's nobody\nleft to leave. But there are beacon satellites to record any calls and\nto warn any fool against landing. If the chlorophage got loose and was\ncarried about by spaceships, it could kill the other forty billion\nhumans in the galaxy, together with every green plant or animal with\nhemoglobin in its blood.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Jensen, and tried to smile, \"sounds final.\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" Nordenfeld told him. \"If there's something in the\nuniverse which can kill every living thing except its maker, that\nsomething should be killed. There should be research going on about\nthe chlorophage. It would be deadly dangerous work, but it should be\ndone. A quarantine won't stop contagion. It can only hinder it. That's\nuseful, but not enough.\"\n\nJensen moistened his lips.\n\nNordenfeld said abruptly, \"I've answered your questions. Now what's on\nyour mind and what has it to do with chlorophage?\"\n\nJensen started. He went very pale.\n\n\"It's too late to do anything about it,\" said Nordenfeld. \"It's\nprobably nonsense anyhow. But what is it?\"\n\nJensen stammered out his story. It explained why there were so many\npassengers for the _Star Queen_. It even explained his departure from\nAltaira. But it was only a rumor--the kind of rumor that starts up\nuntraceably and can never be verified. This one was officially denied\nby the Altairan planetary government. But it was widely believed by the\nsort of people who usually were well-informed. Those who could sent\ntheir families up to the _Star Queen_. And that was why Jensen had been\ntense and worried until the liner had actually left Altaira behind.\nThen he felt safe.\n\nNordenfeld's jaw set as Jensen told his tale. He made no comment, but\nwhen Jensen was through he nodded and went away, leaving his drink\nunfinished. Jensen couldn't see his face; it was hard as granite.\n\nAnd Nordenfeld, the ship's doctor of the _Star Queen_, went into the\nnearest bathroom and was violently sick. It was a reaction to what he'd\njust learned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were stars which were so far away that their distance didn't\nmean anything. There were planets beyond counting in a single star\ncluster, let alone the galaxy. There were comets and gas clouds in\nspace, and worlds where there was life, and other worlds where life was\nimpossible. The quantity of matter which was associated with life was\ninfinitesimal, and the quantity associated with consciousness--animal\nlife--was so much less that the difference couldn't be expressed.\nBut the amount of animal life which could reason was so minute by\ncomparison that the nearest ratio would be that of a single atom to\na sun. Mankind, in fact, was the least impressive fraction of the\nsmallest category of substance in the galaxy.\n\nBut men did curious things.\n\nThere was the cutting off of the _Star Queen's_ short-distance drive\nbefore she'd gotten well away from Altaira. There had been a lift-ship\nlocked to the liner's passenger airlock. When the last passenger\nentered the big ship--a little girl--the airlocks disconnected and the\nlift-ship pulled swiftly away.\n\nIt was not quite two miles from the _Star Queen_ when its emergency\nairlocks opened and spacesuited figures plunged out of it to emptiness.\nSimultaneously, the ports of the lift-ship glowed and almost\nimmediately the whole plating turned cherry-red, crimson, and then\norange, from unlimited heat developed within it.\n\nThe lift-ship went incandescent and ruptured and there was a spout\nof white-hot air, and then it turned blue-white and puffed itself to\nnothing in metallic steam. Where it had been there was only shining\ngas, which cooled. Beyond it there were figures in spacesuits which\ntried to swim away from it.\n\nThe _Star Queen's_ control room, obviously, saw the happening. The\nlift-ship's atomic pile had flared out of control and melted down the\nship. It had developed something like sixty thousand degrees Fahrenheit\nwhen it ceased to flare. It did not blow up; it only vaporized. But\nthe process must have begun within seconds after the lift-ship broke\ncontact with the _Star Queen_.\n\nIn automatic reaction, the man in control of the liner cut her drive\nand offered to turn back and pick up the spacesuited figures in\nemptiness. The offer was declined with almost hysterical haste. In\nfact, it was barely made before the other lift-ships moved in on rescue\nmissions. They had waited. And they were picking up castaways before\nthe _Star Queen_ resumed its merely interplanetary drive and the\nprocess of aiming for a solar system some thirty light-years away.\n\nWhen the liner flicked into overdrive, more than half the floating\nfigures had been recovered, which was remarkable. It was almost as\nremarkable as the flare-up of the lift-ship's atomic pile. One has\nto know exactly what to do to make a properly designed atomic pile\nvaporize metal. Somebody had known. Somebody had done it. And the other\nlift-ships were waiting to pick up the destroyed lift-ship's crew when\nit happened.\n\nThe matter of the lift-ship's destruction was fresh in Nordenfeld's\nmind when Jensen had told his story. The two items fitted together with\nan appalling completeness. They left little doubt or hope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld consulted the passenger records and presently was engaged in\nconversation with the sober-faced, composed little girl on a sofa in\none of the cabin levels of the _Star Queen_.\n\n\"You're Kathy Brand, I believe,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"I\nunderstand you've been having a rather bad time of it.\"\n\nShe seemed to consider.\n\n\"It hasn't been too bad,\" she assured him. \"At least I've been seeing\nnew things. I got dreadfully tired of seeing the same things all the\ntime.\"\n\n\"What things?\" asked Nordenfeld. His expression was not stern now,\nthough his inner sensations were not pleasant. He needed to talk to\nthis child, and he had learned how to talk to children. The secret is\nto talk exactly as to an adult, with respect and interest.\n\n\"There weren't any windows,\" she explained, \"and my father couldn't\nplay with me, and all the toys and books were ruined by the water. It\nwas dreadfully tedious. There weren't any other children, you see. And\npresently there weren't any grownups but my father.\"\n\nNordenfeld only looked more interested. He'd been almost sure ever\nsince knowing of the lift-ship's destruction and listening to Jensen's\naccount of the rumor the government of Altaira denied. He was horribly\nsure now.\n\n\"How long were you in the place that hadn't any windows?\"\n\n\"Oh, dreadfully long!\" she said. \"Since I was only six years old!\nAlmost half my life!\" She smiled brightly at him. \"I remember looking\nout of windows and even playing out-of-doors, but my father and mother\nsaid I had to live in this place. My father talked to me often and\noften. He was very nice. But he had to wear that funny suit and keep\nthe glass over his face because he didn't live in the room. The glass\nwas because he went under the water, you know.\"\n\nNordenfeld asked carefully conversational-sounding questions. Kathy\nBrand, now aged ten, had been taken by her father to live in a big room\nwithout any windows. It hadn't any doors, either. There were plants in\nit, and there were bluish lights to shine on the plants, and there was\na place in one corner where there was water. When her father came in to\ntalk to her, he came up out of the water wearing the funny suit with\nglass over his face. He went out the same way. There was a place in\nthe wall where she could look out into another room, and at first her\nmother used to come and smile at her through the glass, and she talked\ninto something she held in her hand, and her voice came inside. But\nlater she stopped coming.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was only one possible kind of place which would answer Kathy's\ndescription. When she was six years old she had been put into some\nuniversity's aseptic-environment room. And she had stayed there. Such\nrooms were designed for biological research. They were built and then\nmade sterile of all bacterial life and afterward entered through a tank\nof antiseptic. Anyone who entered wore a suit which was made germ-free\nby its passage through the antiseptic, and he did not breathe the air\nof the aseptic room, but air which was supplied him through a hose, the\nexhaled-air hose also passing under the antiseptic outside. No germ\nor microbe or virus could possibly get into such a room without being\nbathed in corrosive fluid which would kill it. So long as there was\nsomeone alive outside to take care of her, a little girl could live\nthere and defy even chlorophage.\n\nAnd Kathy Brand had done it. But, on the other hand, Kamerun was the\nonly planet where it would be necessary, and it was the only world\nfrom which a father would land his small daughter on another planet's\nspaceport. There was no doubt. Nordenfeld grimly imagined someone--he\nwould have had to be a microbiologist even to attempt it--fighting to\nsurvive and defeat the chlorophage while he kept his little girl in an\naseptic-environment room.\n\nShe explained quite pleasantly as Nordenfeld asked more questions.\nThere had been other people besides her father, but for a long time\nthere had been only him. And Nordenfeld computed that somehow she'd\nbeen kept alive on the dead planet Kamerun for four long years.\n\nRecently, though--very recently--her father told her that they were\nleaving. Wearing his funny, antiseptic-wetted suit, he'd enclosed her\nin a plastic bag with a tank attached to it. Air flowed from the tank\ninto the bag and out through a hose that was all wetted inside. She\nbreathed quite comfortably.\n\nIt made sense. An air tank could be heated and its contents sterilized\nto supply germ-free--or virus-free--air. And Kathy's father took an axe\nand chopped away a wall of the room. He picked her up, still inside the\nplastic bag, and carried her out. There was nobody about. There was no\ngrass. There were no trees. Nothing moved.\n\nHere Kathy's account was vague, but Nordenfeld could guess at the\nstrangeness of a dead planet, to the child who barely remembered\nanything but the walls of an aseptic-environment room.\n\nHer father carried her to a little ship, said Kathy, and they talked\na lot after the ship took off. He told her that he was taking her to\na place where she could run about outdoors and play, but he had to go\nsomewhere else. He did mysterious things which to Nordenfeld meant a\nmost scrupulous decontamination of a small spaceship's interior and\nits airlock. Its outer surface would reach a temperature at which no\norganic material could remain uncooked.\n\nAnd finally, said Kathy, her father had opened a door and told her to\nstep out and good-by, and she did, and the ship went away--her father\nstill wearing his funny suit--and people came and asked her questions\nshe did not understand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKathy's narrative fitted perfectly into the rumor Jensen said\ncirculated among usually well-informed people on Altaira. They\nbelieved, said Jensen, that a small spaceship had appeared in the sky\nabove Altaira's spaceport. It ignored all calls, landed swiftly, opened\nan airlock and let someone out, and plunged for the sky again. And the\nstory said that radar telescopes immediately searched for and found\nthe ship in space. They trailed it, calling vainly for it to identify\nitself, while it drove at top speed for Altaira's sun.\n\nIt reached the sun and dived in.\n\nNordenfeld reached the skipper on intercom vision-phone. Jensen had\nbeen called there to repeat his tale to the skipper.\n\n\"I've talked to the child,\" said Nordenfeld grimly, \"and I'm putting\nher into isolation quarters in the hospital compartment. She's from\nKamerun. She was kept in an aseptic-environment room at some university\nor other. She says her father looked after her. I get an impression of\na last-ditch fight by microbiologists against the chlorophage. They\nlost it. Apparently her father landed her on Altaira and dived into\nthe sun. From her story, he took every possible precaution to keep her\nfrom contagion or carrying contagion with her to Altaira. Maybe he\nsucceeded. There's no way to tell--yet.\"\n\nThe skipper listened in silence.\n\nJensen said thinly, \"Then the story about the landing was true.\"\n\n\"Yes. The authorities isolated her, and then shipped her off on the\n_Star Queen_. Your well-informed friends, Jensen, didn't know what\ntheir government was going to do!\" Nordenfeld paused, and said more\ncoldly still, \"They didn't handle it right. They should have killed\nher, painlessly but at once. Her body should have been immersed, with\neverything that had touched it, in full-strength nitric acid. The\nsame acid should have saturated the place where the ship landed and\nevery place she walked. Every room she entered, and every hall she\npassed through, should have been doused with nitric and then burned.\nIt would still not have been all one could wish. The air she breathed\ncouldn't be recaptured and heated white-hot. But the chances for\nAltaira's population to go on living would be improved. Instead, they\nisolated her and they shipped her off with us--and thought they were\naccomplishing something by destroying the lift-ship that had her in an\nairtight compartment until she walked into the _Star Queen's_ lock!\"\n\nThe skipper said heavily, \"Do you think she's brought chlorophage on\nboard?\"\n\n\"I've no idea,\" said Nordenfeld. \"If she did, it's too late to do\nanything but drive the _Star Queen_ into the nearest sun.... No. Before\nthat, one should give warning that she was aground on Altaira. No ship\nshould land there. No ship should take off. Altaira should be blocked\noff from the rest of the galaxy like Kamerun was. And to the same end\nresult.\"\n\nJensen said unsteadily; \"There'll be trouble if this is known on the\nship. There'll be some unwilling to sacrifice themselves.\"\n\n\"Sacrifice?\" said Nordenfeld. \"They're dead! But before they lie down,\nthey can keep everybody they care about from dying too! Would you want\nto land and have your wife and family die of it?\"\n\nThe skipper said in the same heavy voice, \"What are the probabilities?\nYou say there was an effort to keep her from contagion. What are the\nodds?\"\n\n\"Bad,\" said Nordenfeld. \"The man tried, for the child's sake. But I\ndoubt he managed to make a completely aseptic transfer from the room\nshe lived in to the spaceport on Altaira. The authorities on Altaira\nshould have known it. They should have killed her and destroyed\neverything she'd touched. And _still_ the odds would have been bad!\"\n\nJensen said, \"But you can't do that, Nordenfeld! Not now!\"\n\n\"I shall take every measure that seems likely to be useful.\" Then\nNordenfeld snapped, \"Damnation, man! Do you realize that this\nchlorophage can wipe out the human race if it really gets loose? Do you\nthink I'll let sentiment keep me from doing what has to be done?\"\n\nHe flicked off the vision-phone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Star Queen_ came out of overdrive. Her skipper arranged it to be\ndone at the time when the largest possible number of her passengers\nand crew would be asleep. Those who were awake, of course, felt the\npeculiar inaudible sensation which one subjectively translated into\nsound. They felt the momentary giddiness which--having no natural\nparallel--feels like the sensation of treading on a stair-step that\nisn't there, combined with a twisting sensation so it is like a spiral\nfall. The passengers who were awake were mostly in the bars, and the\nbartenders explained that the ship had shifted overdrive generators and\nthere was nothing to it.\n\nThose who were asleep started awake, but there was nothing in their\nsurroundings to cause alarm. Some blinked in the darkness of their\ncabins and perhaps turned on the cabin lights, but everything seemed\nnormal. They turned off the lights again. Some babies cried and had to\nbe soothed. But there was nothing except wakening to alarm anybody.\nBabies went back to sleep and mothers returned to their beds and--such\nawakenings being customary--went back to sleep also.\n\nIt was natural enough. There were vague and commonplace noises,\ntogether making an indefinite hum. Fans circulated the ship's purified\nand reinvigorated air. Service motors turned in remote parts of the\nhull. Cooks and bakers moved about in the kitchens. Nobody could tell\nby any physical sensation that the _Star Queen_ was not in overdrive,\nexcept in the control room.\n\nThere the stars could be seen. They were unthinkably remote. The ship\nwas light-years from any place where humans lived. She did not drive.\nHer skipper had a family on Cassim. He would not land a plague ship\nwhich might destroy them. The executive officer had a small son. If\nhis return meant that small son's death as well as his own, he would\nnot return. All through the ship, the officers who had to know the\nsituation recognized that if chlorophage had gotten into the _Star\nQueen_, the ship must not land anywhere. Nobody could survive. Nobody\nmust attempt it.\n\nSo the huge liner hung in the emptiness between the stars, waiting\nuntil it could be known definitely that chlorophage was aboard or that\nwith absolute certainty it was absent. The question was up to Doctor\nNordenfeld.\n\nHe had isolated himself with Kathy in the ship's hospital compartment.\nSince the ship was built it had been used once by a grown man who\ndeveloped mumps, and once by an adolescent boy who developed a raging\nfever which antibiotics stopped. Health measures for space travel were\nstrict. The hospital compartment had only been used those two times.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn this voyage it had been used to contain an assortment of botanical\nspecimens from a planet seventy light-years beyond Regulus. They were\non their way to the botanical research laboratory on Cassim. As a\nroutine precaution they'd been placed in the hospital, which could\nbe fumigated when they were taken out. Now the doctor had piled them\nin one side of the compartment, which he had divided in half with a\ntransparent plastic sheet. He stayed in that side. Kathy occupied the\nother.\n\nShe had some flowering plants to look at and admire. They'd come from\nthe air room and she was delighted with their coloring and beauty.\nBut Doctor Nordenfeld had put them there as a continuing test for\nchlorophage. If Kathy carried that murderous virus on her person, the\nflowering plants would die of it--probably even before she did.\n\nIt was a scrupulously scientific test for the deadly stuff. Completely\nsealed off except for a circulator to freshen the air she breathed,\nKathy was settled with toys and picture books. It was an improvised\nbut well-designed germproof room. The air for Kathy to breathe was\nsterilized before it reached her. The air she had breathed was\nsterilized as it left her plastic-sided residence. It should be the\nperfection of protection for the ship--if it was not already too late.\n\nThe vision-phone buzzed. Doctor Nordenfeld stirred in his chair and\nflipped the switch. The _Star Queen's_ skipper looked at him out of the\nscreen.\n\n\"I've cut the overdrive,\" said the skipper. \"The passengers haven't\nbeen told.\"\n\n\"Very sensible,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"When will we know?\"\n\n\"That we can go on living? When the other possibility is exhausted.\"\n\n\"Then, how will we know?\" asked skipper stonily.\n\nDoctor Nordenfeld ticked off the possibilities. He bent down a finger.\n\"One, her father took great pains. Maybe he did manage an aseptic\ntransfer from a germ-free room to Altaira. Kathy may not have been\nexposed to the chlorophage. If she hasn't, no bleached spots will show\nup on the air-room foliage or among the flowering plants in the room\nwith her. Nobody in the crew or among the passengers will die.\"\n\nHe bent down a second finger. \"It is probably more likely that white\nspots will appear on the plants in the air room _and_ here, and people\nwill start to die. That will mean Kathy brought contagion here the\ninstant she arrived, and almost certainly that Altaira will become like\nKamerun--uninhabited. In such a case we are finished.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe bent down a third finger. \"Not so likely, but preferable, white\nspots may appear on the foliage inside the plastic with Kathy, but not\nin the ship's air room. In that case she was exposed, but the virus was\nincubating when she came on board, and only developed and spread after\nshe was isolated. Possibly, in such a case, we can save the passengers\nand crew, but the ship will probably have to be melted down in space.\nIt would be tricky, but it might be done.\"\n\nThe skipper hesitated. \"If that last happened, she--\"\n\n\"I will take whatever measures are necessary,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld.\n\"To save your conscience, we won't discuss them. They should have been\ntaken on Altaira.\"\n\nHe reached over and flipped off the phone. Then he looked up and into\nthe other part of the ship's hospital space. Kathy came out from behind\na screen, where she'd made ready for bed. She was beaming. She had a\nlarge picture book under one arm and a doll under the other.\n\n\"It's all right for me to have these with me, isn't it, Doctor\nNordenfeld?\" she asked hopefully. \"I didn't have any picture books but\none, and it got worn out. And my doll--it was dreadful how shabby she\nwas!\"\n\nThe doctor frowned. She smiled at him. He said, \"After all, picture\nbooks are made to be looked at and dolls to be played with.\"\n\nShe skipped to the tiny hospital bed on the far side of the presumably\nvirusproof partition. She climbed into it and zestfully arranged the\ndoll to share it. She placed the book within easy reach.\n\nShe said, \"I think my father would say you were very nice, Doctor\nNordenfeld, to look after me so well.\"\n\n\"No-o-o-o,\" said the doctor in a detached voice. \"I'm just doing what\nanybody ought to do.\"\n\nShe snuggled down under the covers. He looked at his watch and\nshrugged. It was very easy to confuse official night with official day,\nin space. Everybody else was asleep. He'd been putting Kathy through\ntests which began with measurements of pulse and respiration and\ntemperature and went on from there. Kathy managed them herself, under\nhis direction.\n\nHe settled down with one of the medical books he'd brought into\nthe isolation section with him. Its title was _Decontamination of\nInfectious Material from Different Planets_. He read it grimly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe time came when the _Star Queen_ should have come out of overdrive\nwith the sun Circe blazing fiercely nearby, and a green planet with\nice caps to be approached on interplanetary drive. There should have\nbeen droning, comforting drive noises to assure the passengers--who\nnaturally could not see beyond the ship's steel walls--that they were\nwithin a mere few million miles of a world where sunshine was normal,\nand skies were higher than ship's ceilings, and there were fascinating\nthings to see and do.\n\nSome of the passengers packed their luggage and put it outside their\ncabins to be picked up for landing. But no stewards came for it.\nPresently there was an explanation. The ship had run under maximum\nspeed and the planetfall would be delayed.\n\nThe passengers were disappointed but not concerned. The luggage\nvanished into cabins again.\n\nThe _Star Queen_ floated in space among a thousand thousand million\nstars. Her astrogators had computed a course to the nearest star into\nwhich to drive the _Star Queen_, but it would not be used unless there\nwas mutiny among the crew. It would be better to go in remote orbit\naround Circe III and give the news of chlorophage on Altaira, if Doctor\nNordenfeld reported it on the ship.\n\nTime passed. One day. Two. Three. Then Jensen called the hospital\ncompartment on vision-phone. His expression was dazed. Nordenfeld saw\nthe interior of the control room behind Jensen. He said, \"You're a\npassenger, Jensen. How is it you're in the control room?\"\n\nJensen moistened his lips. \"The skipper thought I'd better not\nassociate with the other passengers. I've stayed with the officers the\npast few days. We--the ones who know what's in prospect--we're keeping\nseparate from the others so--nobody will let anything out by accident.\"\n\n\"Very wise. When the skipper comes back on duty, ask him to call me.\nI've something interesting to tell him.\"\n\n\"He's--checking something now,\" said Jensen. His voice was thin and\nreedy. \"The--air officer reports there are white patches on the plants\nin the air room. They're growing. Fast. He told me to tell you.\nHe's--gone to make sure.\"\n\n\"No need,\" said Nordenfeld bitterly.\n\nHe swung the vision-screen. It faced that part of the hospital space\nbeyond the plastic sheeting. There were potted flowering plants there.\nThey had pleased Kathy. They shared her air. And there were white\npatches on their leaves.\n\n\"I thought,\" said Nordenfeld with an odd mirthless levity, \"that the\nskipper'd be interested. It is of no importance whatever now, but\nI accomplished something remarkable. Kathy's father didn't manage\nan aseptic transfer. She brought the chlorophage with her. But I\nconfined it. The plants on the far side of that plastic sheet show the\nchlorophage patches plainly. I expect Kathy to show signs of anemia\nshortly. I'd decided that drastic measures would have to be taken,\nand it looked like they might work, because I've confined the virus.\nIt's there where Kathy is, but it isn't where I am. All the botanical\nspecimens on my side of the sheet are untouched. The phage hasn't hit\nthem. It is remarkable. But it doesn't matter a damn if the air room's\ninfected. And I was so proud!\"\n\nJensen did not respond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld said ironically, \"Look what I accomplished! I protected\nthe air plants on my side See? They're beautifully green! No sign of\ninfection! It means that a man can work with chlorophage! A laboratory\nship could land on Kamerun and keep itself the equivalent of an\naseptic-environment room while the damned chlorophage was investigated\nand ultimately whipped! And it doesn't matter!\"\n\nJensen said numbly, \"We can't ever make port. We ought--we ought to--\"\n\n\"We'll take the necessary measures,\" Nordenfeld told him. \"Very quietly\nand very efficiently, with neither the crew nor the passengers knowing\nthat Altaira sent the chlorophage on board the _Star Queen_ in the hope\nof banishing it from there. The passengers won't know that their own\nofficials shipped it off with them as they tried to run away.... And\nI was so proud that I'd improvised an aseptic room to keep Kathy in! I\nsterilized the air that went in to her, and I sterilized--\"\n\nThen he stopped. He stopped quite short. He stared at the air unit, set\nup and with two pipes passing through the plastic partition which cut\nthe hospital space in two. He turned utterly white. He went roughly to\nthe air machine. He jerked back its cover. He put his hand inside.\n\nMinutes later he faced back to the vision-screen from which Jensen\nlooked apathetically at him.\n\n\"Tell the skipper to call me,\" he said in a savage tone. \"Tell him to\ncall me instantly he comes back! Before he issues any orders at all!\"\n\nHe bent over the sterilizing equipment and very carefully began to\ndisassemble it. He had it completely apart when Kathy waked. She peered\nat him through the plastic separation sheet.\n\n\"Good morning, Doctor Nordenfeld,\" she said cheerfully.\n\nThe doctor grunted. Kathy smiled at him. She had gotten on very good\nterms with the doctor, since she'd been kept in the ship's hospital.\nShe did not feel that she was isolated. In having the doctor where she\ncould talk to him at any time, she had much more company than ever\nbefore. She had read her entire picture book to him and discussed her\ndoll at length. She took it for granted that when he did not answer or\nfrowned that he was simply busy. But he was company because she could\nsee him.\n\nDoctor Nordenfeld put the air apparatus together with an extremely\npeculiar expression on his face. It had been built for Kathy's special\nisolation by a ship's mechanic. It should sterilize the used air going\ninto Kathy's part of the compartment, and it should sterilize the\nused air pushed out by the supplied fresh air. The hospital itself\nwas an independent sealed unit, with its own chemical air freshener,\nand it had been divided into two. The air freshener was where Doctor\nNordenfeld could attend to it, and the sterilizer pump simply shared\nthe freshening with Kathy. But--\n\nBut the pipe that pumped air to Kathy was brown and discolored from\nhaving been used for sterilizing, and the pipe that brought air back\nwas not. It was cold. It had never been heated.\n\nSo Doctor Nordenfeld had been exposed to any contagion Kathy could\nspread. He hadn't been protected at all. Yet the potted plants on\nKathy's side of the barrier were marked with great white splotches\nwhich grew almost as one looked, while the botanical specimens in the\ndoctor's part of the hospital--as much infected as Kathy's could have\nbeen, by failure of the ship's mechanic to build the sterilizer to work\ntwo ways: the stacked plants, the alien plants, the strange plants from\nseventy light-years beyond Regulus--they were vividly green. There\nwas no trace of chlorophage on them. Yet they had been as thoroughly\nexposed as Doctor Nordenfeld himself!\n\nThe doctor's hands shook. His eyes burned. He took out a surgeon's\nscalpel and ripped the plastic partition from floor to ceiling. Kathy\nwatched interestedly.\n\n\"Why did you do that, Doctor Nordenfeld?\" she asked.\n\nHe said in an emotionless, unnatural voice, \"I'm going to do something\nthat it was very stupid of me not to do before. It should have been\ndone when you were six years old, Kathy. It should have been done on\nKamerun, and after that on Altaira. Now we're going to do it here. You\ncan help me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Star Queen_ had floated out of overdrive long enough to throw all\ndistance computations off. But she swung about, and swam back, and\npresently she was not too far from the world where she was now many\ndays overdue. Lift-ships started up from the planet's surface. But the\n_Star Queen_ ordered them back.\n\n\"Get your spaceport health officer on the vision-phone,\" ordered the\n_Star Queen's_ skipper. \"We've had chlorophage on board.\"\n\nThere was panic. Even at a distance of a hundred thousand miles,\nchlorophage could strike stark terror into anybody. But presently the\nimage of the spaceport health officer appeared on the _Star Queen's_\nscreen.\n\n\"We're not landing,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld. \"There's almost certainly\nan outbreak of chlorophage on Altaira, and we're going back to do\nsomething about it. It got on our ship with passengers from there.\nWe've whipped it, but we may need some help.\"\n\nThe image of the health officer aground was a mask of horror for\nseconds after Nordenfeld's last statement. Then his expression became\nincredulous, though still horrified.\n\n\"We came on to here,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld, \"to get you to send\nword by the first other ship to the Patrol that a quarantine has\nto be set up on Altaira, and we need to be inspected for recovery\nfrom chlorophage infection. And we need to pass on, officially, the\ndiscovery that whipped the contagion on this ship. We were carrying\nbotanical specimens to Cassim and we discovered that they were immune\nto chlorophage. That's absurd, of course. Their green coloring is the\nsame substance as in plants under Sol-type suns anywhere. They couldn't\nbe immune to chlorophage. So there had to be something else.\"\n\n\"Was--was there?\" asked the health officer.\n\n\"There was. Those specimens came from somewhere beyond Regulus. They\ncarried, as normal symbiotes on their foliage, microÃ¶rganisms unknown\nboth on Kamerun and Altaira. The alien bugs are almost the size of\nvirus particles, feed on virus particles, and are carried by contact,\nair, and so on, as readily as virus particles themselves. We discovered\nthat those microÃ¶rganisms devoured chlorophage. We washed them off the\nleaves of the plants, sprayed them in our air-room jungle, and they\nmultiplied faster than the chlorophage. Our whole air supply is now\nloaded with an airborne antichlorophage organism which has made our\ncrew and passengers immune. We're heading back to Altaira to turn loose\nour merry little bugs on that planet. It appears that they grow on\ncertain vegetation, but they'll live anywhere there's phage to eat.\nWe're keeping some chlorophage cultures alive so our microÃ¶rganisms\ndon't die out for lack of food!\"\n\nThe medical officer on the ground gasped. \"Keeping phage _alive_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hope you've recorded this,\" said Nordenfeld. \"It's rather important.\nThis trick should have been tried on Kamerun and Altaira and everywhere\nelse new diseases have turned up. When there's a bug on one planet\nthat's deadly to us, there's bound to be a bug on some other planet\nthat's deadly to it! The same goes for any pests or vermin--the\nprinciple of natural enemies. All we have to do is find the enemies!\"\n\nThere was more communication between the _Star Queen_ and the spaceport\non Circe III, which the _Star Queen_ would not make other contact with\non this trip, and presently the big liner headed back to Altaira. It\nwas necessary for official as well as humanitarian reasons. There would\nneed to be a health examination of the _Star Queen_ to certify that it\nwas safe for passengers to breathe her air and eat in her restaurants\nand swim in her swimming pools and occupy the six levels of passenger\ncabins she contained. This would have to be done by a Patrol ship,\nwhich would turn up at Altaira.\n\nThe _Star Queen's_ skipper would be praised by his owners for not\nhaving driven the liner into a star, and the purser would be forgiven\nfor the confusion in his records due to off-schedule operations of\nthe big ship, and Jensen would find in the ending of all terror of\nchlorophage an excellent reason to look for appreciation in the value\nof the investments he was checking up. And Doctor Nordenfeld....\n\nHe talked very gravely to Kathy. \"I'm afraid,\" he told her, \"that your\nfather isn't coming back. What would you like to do?\"\n\nShe smiled at him hopefully. \"Could I be your little girl?\" she asked.\nDoctor Nordenfeld grunted. \"Hm ... I'll think about it.\"\n\nBut he smiled at her. She grinned at him. And it was settled.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Doctor, by Murray Leinster"}

He is visited before dawn by his old friend Crito, who has made arrangements to smuggle Socrates out of prison to the safety of exile. Socrates seems quite willing to await his imminent execution, and so Crito presents as many arguments as he can to persuade Socrates to escape. On a practical level, Socrates' death will reflect badly on his friends--people will think they did nothing to try to save him. Also, Socrates should not worry about the risk or the financial cost to his friends; these they are willing to pay, and they have also arranged to find Socrates a pleasant life in exile. On a more ethical level, Crito presents two more pressing arguments: first, if he stayed, he would be aiding his enemies in wronging him unjustly, and would thus be acting unjustly himself; and second, that he would be abandoning his sons and leaving them without a father.\nSocrates answers first that one should not worry about public opinion, but only listen to wise and expert advice. Crito should not worry about how his, Socrates', or others' reputations may fare in the general esteem: they should only concern themselves with behaving well. The only question at hand is whether or not it would be just for Socrates to attempt an escape. If it is just, he will go with Crito, if it is unjust, he must remain in prison and face death.\nAt this point, Socrates introduces the voice of the Laws of Athens, which speaks to him and proceeds to explain why it would be unjust for him to leave his cell. Since the Laws exist as one entity, to break one would be to break them all, and in doing so, Socrates would cause them great harm. The citizen is bound to the Laws like a child is bound to a parent, and so to go against the Laws would be like striking a parent. Rather than simply break the Laws and escape, Socrates should try to persuade the Laws to let him go. These Laws present the citizen's duty to them in the form of a kind of social contract. By choosing to live in Athens, a citizen is implicitly endorsing the Laws, and is willing to abide by them. Socrates, more than most, should be in accord with this contract, as he has lived a happy seventy years fully content with the Athenian way of life.\nIf Socrates were to break from prison now, having so consistently validated the social contract, he would be making himself an outlaw who would not be welcome in any other civilized state for the rest of his life. And when he dies, he will be harshly judged in the underworld for behaving unjustly toward his city's laws. Thus, Socrates convinces Crito that it would be better not to attempt an escape.", "normalized_text": "ï»¿*********The Project Gutenberg Etext of Crito, by Plato*********\n#16 in our series by Plato\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.  And I know\nthat anything more which you may say will be vain.  Yet speak, if you have\nanything to say.\n\nCRITO:  I have nothing to say, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to follow\nwhither he leads.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of this Project Gutenberg Etext of Crito, by Plato"}

Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, a local gentleman, and Mr. Roundhay, the local vicar, come to Holmes to report that Tregennisâs two brothers have gone insane, and his sister has died. Tregennis had gone to visit them in their village (Tredannick Wollas), played whist with them, and then left. When he came back in the morning, he found them still sitting in their places at the table, the brothers, George and Owen, laughing and singing, and the sister, Brenda, dead. The housekeeper had discovered them in this state, and fainted. The vicar has not been to see them yet. Tregennis says that he remembers one brother looking through the window, and then he himself turned to see some \"movement\" outside. He declares that the horrific event is the work of the devil. Mortimer Tregennis was once estranged from his siblings by the matter of dividing the proceeds from the sale of the family business, but he insists that all was forgiven, although he still lives apart from them. The doctor who was summoned, reckoned that she had been dead for six hours. He also collapsed into a chair for a while after arriving.\nHolmes goes to the house in question and, apparently carelessly, kicks over a watering pot, soaking everyoneâs feet.

HTML version by Al Haines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Devil's Foot\n\n\nBy\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n\n\n\nIn recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and\ninteresting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate\nfriendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by\ndifficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity.  To his sombre\nand cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and\nnothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand\nover the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with\na mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation.  It\nwas indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not\nany lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to\nlay very few of my records before the public.  My participation in some\nof his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and\nreticence upon me.\n\nIt was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\nfrom Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a\ntelegram would serve--in the following terms:\n\nWhy not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled.\n\nI have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter\nfresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should\nrecount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may\narrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the\ncase and to lay the narrative before my readers.\n\nIt was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron\nconstitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant\nhard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional\nindiscretions of his own.  In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of\nHarley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day\nrecount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay\naside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished\nto avert an absolute breakdown.  The state of his health was not a\nmatter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental\ndetachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of\nbeing permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete\nchange of scene and air.  Thus it was that in the early spring of that\nyear we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at\nthe further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.\n\nIt was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim\nhumour of my patient.  From the windows of our little whitewashed\nhouse, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the\nwhole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing\nvessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which\ninnumerable seamen have met their end.  With a northerly breeze it lies\nplacid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it\nfor rest and protection.\n\nThen come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from\nthe south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle\nin the creaming breakers.  The wise mariner stands far out from that\nevil place.\n\nOn the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was\na country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional\nchurch tower to mark the site of some old-world village.  In every\ndirection upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race\nwhich had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange\nmonuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes\nof the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife.\nThe glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of\nforgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he\nspent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the\nmoor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the\nChaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in\ntin.  He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was\nsettling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to\nhis unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,\nplunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more\nengrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had\ndriven us from London.  Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine\nwere violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of\na series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in\nCornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers\nmay retain some recollection of what was called at the time \"The\nCornish Horror,\" though a most imperfect account of the matter reached\nthe London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true\ndetails of this inconceivable affair to the public.\n\nI have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this\npart of Cornwall.  The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick\nWollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered\nround an ancient, moss-grown church.  The vicar of the parish, Mr.\nRoundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had\nmade his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable,\nwith a considerable fund of local lore.  At his invitation we had taken\ntea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis,\nan independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman's scanty\nresources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The vicar,\nbeing a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he\nhad little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled\nman, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical\ndeformity.  I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar\ngarrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced,\nintrospective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon\nhis own affairs.\n\nThese were the two men who entered abruptly into our little\nsitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast\nhour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion\nupon the moors.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" said the vicar in an agitated voice, \"the most\nextraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is\nthe most unheard-of business.  We can only regard it as a special\nProvidence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all\nEngland you are the one man we need.\"\n\nI glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes\ntook his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound\nwho hears the view-halloa.  He waved his hand to the sofa, and our\npalpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon\nit.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,\nbut the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes\nshowed that they shared a common emotion.\n\n\"Shall I speak or you?\" he asked of the vicar.\n\n\"Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and\nthe vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the\nspeaking,\" said Holmes.\n\nI glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed\nlodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's\nsimple deduction had brought to their faces.\n\n\"Perhaps I had best say a few words first,\" said the vicar, \"and then\nyou can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or\nwhether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious\naffair.  I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening\nin the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister\nBrenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old\nstone cross upon the moor.  He left them shortly after ten o'clock,\nplaying cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and\nspirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that\ndirection before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr.\nRichards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent\ncall to Tredannick Wartha.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with\nhim.  When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary\nstate of things.  His two brothers and his sister were seated round the\ntable exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of\nthem and the candles burned down to their sockets.  The sister lay back\nstone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her\nlaughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.\nAll three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained\nupon their faces an expression of the utmost horror--a convulsion of\nterror which was dreadful to look upon.  There was no sign of the\npresence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and\nhousekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound\nduring the night.  Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is\nabsolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has\nfrightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses.\nThere is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help\nus to clear it up you will have done a great work.\"\n\nI had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the\nquiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his\nintense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the\nexpectation.  He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the\nstrange drama which had broken in upon our peace.\n\n\"I will look into this matter,\" he said at last.  \"On the face of it,\nit would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you\nbeen there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the\nvicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.\"\n\n\"How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?\"\n\n\"About a mile inland.\"\n\n\"Then we shall walk over together.  But before we start I must ask you\na few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nThe other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his\nmore controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion\nof the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze\nfixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together.\nHis pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which\nhad befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something\nof the horror of the scene.\n\n\"Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing\nto speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"\n\n\"Tell me about last night.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder\nbrother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat down about\nnine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.  I left\nthem all round the table, as merry as could be.\"\n\n\"Who let you out?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall\ndoor behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed,\nbut the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or\nwindow this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been\nto the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and\nBrenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the\nchair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as\nI live.\"\n\n\"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said\nHolmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any\nway account for them?\"\n\n\"It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is\nnot of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed\nthe light of reason from their minds.  What human contrivance could do\nthat?\"\n\n\"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond humanity it is\ncertainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations\nbefore we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr.\nTregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,\nsince they lived together and you had rooms apart?\"\n\n\"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We\nwere a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a\ncompany, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that\nthere was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood\nbetween us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we\nwere the best of friends together.\"\n\n\"Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything\nstand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the\ntragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help\nme.\"\n\n\"There is nothing at all, sir.\"\n\n\"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"\n\n\"Never better.\"\n\n\"Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of\ncoming danger?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.\n\n\"There is one thing occurs to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the\ntable my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my\npartner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look hard over my\nshoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the\nwindow shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it\nseemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I\ncouldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was\nsomething there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me\nthat he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"\n\n\"Did you not investigate?\"\n\n\"No; the matter passed as unimportant.\"\n\n\"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"\n\n\"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This\nmorning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook\nme.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent\nmessage.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we\nlooked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have\nburned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark\nuntil dawn had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at\nleast six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across\nthe arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were\nsinging snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it\nwas awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as\na sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we\nnearly had him on our hands as well.\"\n\n\"Remarkable--most remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.\n\"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without\nfurther delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at\nfirst sight presented a more singular problem.\"\n\n\nOur proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the\ninvestigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident\nwhich left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to\nthe spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding,\ncountry lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a\ncarriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove\nby us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly\ncontorted, grinning face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and\ngnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.\n\n\"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are\ntaking them to Helston.\"\n\nWe looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way.\nThen we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they\nhad met their strange fate.\n\nIt was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with\na considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well\nfilled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the\nsitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,\nmust have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single\ninstant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully\namong the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch.\nSo absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over\nthe watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the\ngarden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked\nafter the wants of the family.  She readily answered all Holmes's\nquestions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her employers had all\nbeen in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more\ncheerful and prosperous.  She had fainted with horror upon entering the\nroom in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table.\nShe had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning\nair in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for\nthe doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her.\nIt took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage.\nShe would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting\nthat very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.\n\nWe ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had\nbeen a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.  Her\ndark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still\nlingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been\nher last human emotion.  From her bedroom we descended to the\nsitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The\ncharred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate.  On the table\nwere the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered\nover its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls,\nbut all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with\nlight, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs,\ndrawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He tested how much\nof the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the\nfireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes\nand tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some\ngleam of light in this utter darkness.\n\n\"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small\nroom on a spring evening?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that\nreason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do\nnow, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.\n\nMy friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that\nI shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often\nand so justly condemned,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen,\nwe will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new\nfactor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts\nover in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will\ncertainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish\nyou both good-morning.\"\n\nIt was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes\nbroke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his\narmchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue\nswirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead\ncontracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his\npipe and sprang to his feet.\n\n\"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the\ncliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more likely to\nfind them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work without\nsufficient material is like racing an engine.  It racks itself to\npieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson--all else will\ncome.\n\n\"Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we\nskirted the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm grip of the very\nlittle which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready\nto fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that\nneither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the\naffairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds.\nVery good.  There remain three persons who have been grievously\nstricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.  That is firm\nground.  Now, when did this occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative\nto be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left\nthe room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it\nwas within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the\ntable. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not\nchanged their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then,\nthat the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later\nthan eleven o'clock last night.\n\n\"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of\nMortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no\ndifficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as\nyou do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot\nexpedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might\notherwise have been possible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably.\nLast night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not\ndifficult--having obtained a sample print--to pick out his track among\nothers and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away\nswiftly in the direction of the vicarage.\n\n\"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some\noutside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that\nperson, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter\nmay be eliminated.  She is evidently harmless.  Is there any evidence\nthat someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced\nso terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their\nsenses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer\nTregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement\nin the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,\ncloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm these people\nwould be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he\ncould be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-border outside this\nwindow, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine,\nthen, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon\nthe company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and\nelaborate an attempt.  You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\"\n\n\"They are only too clear,\" I answered with conviction.\n\n\"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not\ninsurmountable,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your extensive\narchives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure.\nMeanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are\navailable, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of\nneolithic man.\"\n\nI may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but\nnever have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in\nCornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and\nshards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his\nsolution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our\ncottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds\nback to the matter in hand.  Neither of us needed to be told who that\nvisitor was.  The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the\nfierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed\nour cottage ceiling, the beard--golden at the fringes and white near\nthe lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar--all\nthese were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be\nassociated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the\ngreat lion-hunter and explorer.\n\nWe had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice\ncaught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no\nadvances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,\nas it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him\nto spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a\nsmall bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here,\namid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life,\nattending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to\nthe affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to\nhear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any\nadvance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  \"The county\npolice are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider\nexperience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim\nto being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences\nhere I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed,\nupon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their\nstrange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you\nthat I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news\nreached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the\ninquiry.\"\n\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Did you lose your boat through it?\"\n\n\"I will take the next.\"\n\n\"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"\n\n\"I tell you they were relatives.\"\n\n\"Quite so--cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"\n\n\"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the\nPlymouth morning papers.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"\n\n\"Might I ask from whom?\"\n\nA shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.\n\n\"You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"It is my business.\"\n\nWith an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.\n\n\"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay,\nthe vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original\nquestion that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of\nthis case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.  It\nwould be premature to say more.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any\nparticular direction?\"\n\n\"No, I can hardly answer that.\"\n\n\"Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\"  The famous\ndoctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within\nfive minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the\nevening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which\nassured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation.\nHe glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.\n\n\"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it\nfrom the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's\naccount was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last night\nthere, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to\nAfrica, while he returned to be present at this investigation.  What do\nyou make of that, Watson?\"\n\n\"He is deeply interested.\"\n\n\"Deeply interested--yes.  There is a thread here which we had not yet\ngrasped and which might lead us through the tangle.  Cheer up, Watson,\nfor I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand.\nWhen it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\"\n\nLittle did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or\nhow strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up\nan entirely fresh line of investigation.  I was shaving at my window in\nthe morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a\ndog-cart coming at a gallop down the road.  It pulled up at our door,\nand our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden\npath. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.\n\nOur visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last\nin gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.\n\n\"We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-ridden!\" he\ncried.  \"Satan himself is loose in it!  We are given over into his\nhands!\"  He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it\nwere not for his ashy face and startled eyes.  Finally he shot out his\nterrible news.\n\n\"Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the\nsame symptoms as the rest of his family.\"\n\nHolmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.\n\n\"Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can.\"\n\n\"Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we are\nentirely at your disposal.  Hurry--hurry, before things get\ndisarranged.\"\n\nThe lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle\nby themselves, the one above the other.  Below was a large\nsitting-room; above, his bedroom.  They looked out upon a croquet lawn\nwhich came up to the windows.  We had arrived before the doctor or the\npolice, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed.  Let me describe\nexactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning.  It has\nleft an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.\n\nThe atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness.\nThe servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would\nhave been even more intolerable.  This might partly be due to the fact\nthat a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table.  Beside it\nsat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting,\nhis spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face\nturned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of\nterror which had marked the features of his dead sister.  His limbs\nwere convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a\nvery paroxysm of fear.  He was fully clothed, though there were signs\nthat his dressing had been done in a hurry.  We had already learned\nthat his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him\nin the early morning.\n\nOne realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic\nexterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the\nmoment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In an instant he was tense\nand alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with\neager activity.  He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round\nthe room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing\nfoxhound drawing a cover.  In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around\nand ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some\nfresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud\nejaculations of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the stair,\nout through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn,\nsprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the\nhunter who is at the very heels of his quarry.  The lamp, which was an\nordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain\nmeasurements upon its bowl.  He carefully scrutinized with his lens the\ntalc shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some\nashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an\nenvelope, which he placed in his pocketbook.  Finally, just as the\ndoctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the\nvicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.\n\n\"I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,\"\nhe remarked.  \"I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police,\nbut I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give\nthe inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom\nwindow and to the sitting-room lamp.  Each is suggestive, and together\nthey are almost conclusive.  If the police would desire further\ninformation I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage.  And\nnow, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed\nelsewhere.\"\n\nIt may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that\nthey imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation;\nbut it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two\ndays.  During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and\ndreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which\nhe undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to\nwhere he had been.  One experiment served to show me the line of his\ninvestigation.  He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one\nwhich had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of\nthe tragedy.  This he filled with the same oil as that used at the\nvicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be\nexhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant\nnature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.\n\n\"You will remember, Watson,\" he remarked one afternoon, \"that there is\na single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have\nreached us.  This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in\neach case upon those who had first entered it.  You will recollect that\nMortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his\nbrother's house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell\ninto a chair? You had forgotten?  Well I can answer for it that it was\nso. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told\nus that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards\nopened the window.  In the second case--that of Mortimer Tregennis\nhimself--you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room\nwhen we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window.  That\nservant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed.\nYou will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive.  In each\ncase there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere.  In each case, also,\nthere is combustion going on in the room--in the one case a fire, in\nthe other a lamp.  The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit--as a\ncomparison of the oil consumed will show--long after it was broad\ndaylight.  Why?  Surely because there is some connection between three\nthings--the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness\nor death of those unfortunate people.  That is clear, is it not?\"\n\n\"It would appear so.\"\n\n\"At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis.  We will suppose,\nthen, that something was burned in each case which produced an\natmosphere causing strange toxic effects.  Very good. In the first\ninstance--that of the Tregennis family--this substance was placed in\nthe fire.  Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry\nfumes to some extent up the chimney.  Hence one would expect the\neffects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there\nwas less escape for the vapour.  The result seems to indicate that it\nwas so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the\nmore sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that\ntemporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of\nthe drug.  In the second case the result was complete.  The facts,\ntherefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by\ncombustion.\n\n\"With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in\nMortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this substance.  The\nobvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-guard of the lamp.\nThere, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the\nedges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed.\nHalf of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.\"\n\n\"Why half, Holmes?\"\n\n\"It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official\npolice force.  I leave them all the evidence which I found.  The poison\nstill remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.  Now, Watson,\nwe will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open\nour window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of\nsociety, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an\narmchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to\ndo with the affair.  Oh, you will see it out, will you?  I thought I\nknew my Watson.  This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may\nbe the same distance from the poison and face to face.  The door we\nwill leave ajar.  Each is now in a position to watch the other and to\nbring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming.  Is\nthat all clear?  Well, then, I take our powder--or what remains of\nit--from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp.  So!  Now,\nWatson, let us sit down and await developments.\"\n\nThey were not long in coming.  I had hardly settled in my chair before\nI was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous.  At the\nvery first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all\ncontrol.  A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told\nme that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my\nappalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was\nmonstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe.  Vague shapes\nswirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning\nof something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the\nthreshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul.  A freezing horror\ntook possession of me.  I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes\nwere protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather.\nThe turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap.\nI tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was\nmy own voice, but distant and detached from myself.  At the same moment,\nin some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had\na glimpse of Holmes's face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror--the\nvery look which I had seen upon the features of the dead.  It was that\nvision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength.  I dashed\nfrom my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched\nthrough the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down\nupon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the\nglorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud\nof terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the\nmists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were\nsitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with\napprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific\nexperience which we had undergone.\n\n\"Upon my word, Watson!\" said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, \"I\nowe you both my thanks and an apology.  It was an unjustifiable\nexperiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend.  I am\nreally very sorry.\"\n\n\"You know,\" I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much\nof Holmes's heart before, \"that it is my greatest joy and privilege to\nhelp you.\"\n\nHe relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was\nhis habitual attitude to those about him.  \"It would be superfluous to\ndrive us mad, my dear Watson,\" said he.  \"A candid observer would\ncertainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so\nwild an experiment.  I confess that I never imagined that the effect\ncould be so sudden and so severe.\"  He dashed into the cottage, and,\nreappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw\nit among a bank of brambles. \"We must give the room a little time to\nclear.  I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt\nas to how these tragedies were produced?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"But the cause remains as obscure as before.  Come into the arbour here\nand let us discuss it together.  That villainous stuff seems still to\nlinger round my throat.  I think we must admit that all the evidence\npoints to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the\nfirst tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one.  We must\nremember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family\nquarrel, followed by a reconciliation.  How bitter that quarrel may\nhave been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell.   When I\nthink of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd,\nbeady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge\nto be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place,\nyou will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which\ntook our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy,\nemanated from him.  He had a motive in misleading us.  Finally, if he\ndid not throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the\nroom, who did do so?  The affair happened immediately after his\ndeparture. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have\nrisen from the table.  Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not\narrive after ten o'clock at night.  We may take it, then, that all the\nevidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.\"\n\n\"Then his own death was suicide!\"\n\n\"Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition.\nThe man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate\nupon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon\nhimself.  There are, however, some cogent reasons against it.\nFortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I\nhave made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon\nfrom his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time.  Perhaps you\nwould kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducing\na chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit\nfor the reception of so distinguished a visitor.\"\n\nI had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure\nof the great African explorer appeared upon the path.  He turned in\nsome surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.\n\n\"You sent for me, Mr. Holmes.  I had your note about an hour ago, and I\nhave come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,\" said Holmes.\n\"Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.\nYou will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend\nWatson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the\npapers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for\nthe present.  Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will\naffect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we\nshould talk where there can be no eavesdropping.\"\n\nThe explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my\ncompanion.\n\n\"I am at a loss to know, sir,\" he said, \"what you can have to speak\nabout which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.\"\n\n\"The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,\" said Holmes.\n\nFor a moment I wished that I were armed.  Sterndale's fierce face\nturned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate\nveins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with\nclenched hands towards my companion.  Then he stopped, and with a\nviolent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps,\nmore suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.\n\n\"I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,\" said he, \"that\nI have got into the way of being a law to myself.  You would do well,\nMr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.\"\n\n\"Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the\nclearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you\nand not for the police.\"\n\nSterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time\nin his adventurous life.  There was a calm assurance of power in\nHolmes's manner which could not be withstood.  Our visitor stammered\nfor a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked at last.  \"If this is bluff upon your\npart, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us\nhave no more beating about the bush.  What DO you mean?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" said Holmes, \"and the reason why I tell you is that\nI hope frankness may beget frankness.  What my next step may be will\ndepend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.\"\n\n\"My defence?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"My defence against what?\"\n\n\"Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nSterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.  \"Upon my word,\nyou are getting on,\" said he.  \"Do all your successes depend upon this\nprodigious power of bluff?\"\n\n\"The bluff,\" said Holmes sternly, \"is upon your side, Dr. Leon\nSterndale, and not upon mine.  As a proof I will tell you some of the\nfacts upon which my conclusions are based.  Of your return from\nPlymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say\nnothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors\nwhich had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama--\"\n\n\"I came back--\"\n\n\"I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and\ninadequate.  We will pass that.  You came down here to ask me whom I\nsuspected.  I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage,\nwaited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"I followed you.\"\n\n\"I saw no one.\"\n\n\"That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.  You spent a\nrestless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in\nthe early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your\ndoor just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish\ngravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.\"\n\nSterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.\n\n\"You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the\nvicarage.  You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed\ntennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet.  At the\nvicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out\nunder the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the\nhousehold was not yet stirring.  You drew some of the gravel from your\npocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.\"\n\nSterndale sprang to his feet.\n\n\"I believe that you are the devil himself!\" he cried.\n\nHolmes smiled at the compliment.  \"It took two, or possibly three,\nhandfuls before the lodger came to the window.  You beckoned him to\ncome down.  He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room.\nYou entered by the window.  There was an interview--a short one--during\nwhich you walked up and down the room.  Then you passed out and closed\nthe window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching\nwhat occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as\nyou had come.  Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and\nwhat were the motives for your actions?  If you prevaricate or trifle\nwith me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my\nhands forever.\"\n\nOur visitor's face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the words of\nhis accuser.  Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in\nhis hands.  Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a\nphotograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table\nbefore us.\n\n\"That is why I have done it,\" said he.\n\nIt showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman.  Holmes stooped\nover it.\n\n\"Brenda Tregennis,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, Brenda Tregennis,\" repeated our visitor.  \"For years I have loved\nher.  For years she has loved me.  There is the secret of that Cornish\nseclusion which people have marvelled at.  It has brought me close to\nthe one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for\nI have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable\nlaws of England, I could not divorce.  For years Brenda waited.  For\nyears I waited.  And this is what we have waited for.\"  A terrible sob\nshook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled\nbeard.  Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:\n\n\"The vicar knew.  He was in our confidence.  He would tell you that she\nwas an angel upon earth.  That was why he telegraphed to me and I\nreturned.  What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such\na fate had come upon my darling?  There you have the missing clue to my\naction, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said my friend.\n\nDr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the\ntable.  On the outside was written \"Radix pedis diaboli\" with a red\npoison label beneath it.  He pushed it towards me.  \"I understand that\nyou are a doctor, sir.  Have you ever heard of this preparation?\"\n\n\"Devil's-foot root!  No, I have never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,\" said he, \"for I\nbelieve that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no\nother specimen in Europe.  It has not yet found its way either into the\npharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology.  The root is shaped\nlike a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given\nby a botanical missionary.  It is used as an ordeal poison by the\nmedicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a\nsecret among them.  This particular specimen I obtained under very\nextraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.\"  He opened the\npaper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like\npowder.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" asked Holmes sternly.\n\n\"I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for\nyou already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you\nshould know all.  I have already explained the relationship in which I\nstood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was\nfriendly with the brothers.  There was a family quarrel about money\nwhich estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up,\nand I afterwards met him as I did the others.  He was a sly, subtle,\nscheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of\nhim, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.\n\n\"One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I\nshowed him some of my African curiosities.  Among other things I\nexhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it\nstimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and\nhow either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is\nsubjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe.  I told him also\nhow powerless European science would be to detect it.  How he took it I\ncannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it\nwas then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he\nmanaged to abstract some of the devil's-foot root.  I well remember how\nhe plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was\nneeded for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a\npersonal reason for asking.\n\n\"I thought no more of the matter until the vicar's telegram reached me\nat Plymouth.  This villain had thought that I would be at sea before\nthe news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa.\nBut I returned at once.  Of course, I could not listen to the details\nwithout feeling assured that my poison had been used.  I came round to\nsee you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself\nto you.  But there could be none.  I was convinced that Mortimer\nTregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the\nidea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane\nhe would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the\ndevil's-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses,\nand killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever\nloved or who has ever loved me.  There was his crime; what was to be\nhis punishment?\n\n\"Should I appeal to the law?  Where were my proofs?  I knew that the\nfacts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe\nso fantastic a story?  I might or I might not. But I could not afford\nto fail.  My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once\nbefore, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law,\nand that I have come at last to be a law to myself.  So it was even\nnow.  I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be\nshared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my\nown hand.  In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon\nhis own life than I do at the present moment.\n\n\"Now I have told you all.  You have yourself supplied the rest. I did,\nas you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage.  I\nforesaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from\nthe pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his\nwindow.  He came down and admitted me through the window of the\nsitting-room.  I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had\ncome both as judge and executioner.  The wretch sank into a chair,\nparalyzed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder\nabove it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to\nshoot him should he try to leave the room.  In five minutes he died.\nMy God! how he died!  But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing\nwhich my innocent darling had not felt before him.  There is my story,\nMr. Holmes.  Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much\nyourself.  At any rate, I am in your hands.  You can take what steps\nyou like.  As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear\ndeath less than I do.\"\n\nHolmes sat for some little time in silence.\n\n\"What were your plans?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I had intended to bury myself in central Africa.  My work there is but\nhalf finished.\"\n\n\"Go and do the other half,\" said Holmes.  \"I, at least, am not prepared\nto prevent you.\"\n\nDr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from\nthe arbour.  Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.\n\n\"Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,\" said\nhe.  \"I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we\nare called upon to interfere.  Our investigation has been independent,\nand our action shall be so also.  You would not denounce the man?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I answered.\n\n\"I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had\nmet such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done.\nWho knows?  Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by\nexplaining what is obvious.  The gravel upon the window-sill was, of\ncourse, the starting-point of my research.  It was unlike anything in\nthe vicarage garden.  Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr.\nSterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart.  The lamp shining\nin broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were\nsuccessive links in a fairly obvious chain.  And now, my dear Watson, I\nthink we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear\nconscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be\ntraced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventure of the Devil's Foot, by \nArthur Conan Doyle"}

A \"fair Shape out of her hands did flow\" because \"all things together grow/ Through which the harmony of love can pass.\" In Greek mythology, Hermaphrodite was the offspring of Hermes and Aphrodite. The hermaphrodite is androgynous and synthesises the opposing and contradictory aspects of the creative mind. The hermaphrodite is both the companion and the servant to the Witch. The journeys consist of sailing in the air on an airship and in water on a boat, or pinnace. They travel from the Atlas Mountains to the Austral Lake to the Nile Valley. Nature is explored as are fire and electrical energy. The Witch begins her sojourn from the ancient northern Ethiopian city of Axume. Lake Moeris, an ancient lake southwest of Cairo, Egypt, is visited, as are the Mareotid lakes south of Alexandria. King Amasis of Egypt, Memphis, and the bull god Apis are invoked. The forces of creation and destruction are resolved. The objective is a synthesis or union of contradictions.\nThe Witch is the daughter of the Atlantides, who in Greek mythology are called the Pleiades, the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione. Her home, the Atlas Mountains, are a range that stretches across north Africa, from Morocco and Algeria to Tunisia. Her \"choice sport\" was to \"glide adown\" the Nile River into Egypt and Aethiopia with \"tame water-snakes\" and \"ghastly alligators\". She observed mankind at sleep. Injustice and inequality were noted: \"And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;/ And all the code of Custom's lawless law/ Written upon the brows of old and young.\" It is this oppression and exploitation that trouble mankind's existence: \"'This ... is the strife/ Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'\"\nThe \"visionary rhyme\" recounts the pranks the Witch plays on mankind. Like Shelley himself, the Witch was able to perceive the fears and desires of mankind: \"In mine own heart I saw as in a glass/ The hearts of others.\" She is able to see the \"naked beauty\" of the human soul. The Witch gave a \"strange panacea in a crystal bowl\" to those who were the most beautiful and imparted \"strange dreams\" to those who were less beautiful. The Witch sought to change man's perception of death. Death was not to be feared. The Witch took a coffin and \"threw it with contempt into a ditch.\" The grave was \"as a green and overarching bower/ Lit by the gems of many a starry flower.\" She sought to make the world more just and fair by making \"more vain\" all those purposes which were \"harsh and crooked\". The \"miser\" would place \"all his evil gain\" on a \"beggar's lap\". The \"scribe\" would reveal his own lies. Priests would reject dogma and \"old cant\". The king would place an ape on his throne and dress him up in his vestments while a \"mock-bird\" repeated the \"chatterings of the monkey\". War would be practised no more as soldiers turned their swords into ploughshares on \"red anvils\". Finally, \"timid lovers\" would see the \"fulfilment of their inmost thought.\" These are the pranks the Witch \"played among the cities of mortal men.\" The Witch was able to envision and foresee a future Utopia for all mankind.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WITCH OF ATLAS ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Sue Asscher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Witch of Atlas\n\n\nby\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley\n\n\n\n\n\n TO MARY\n (ON HER OBJECTING TO THE FOLLOWING POEM, UPON THE\n SCORE OF ITS CONTAINING NO HUMAN INTEREST).\n\n 1.\n How, my dear Mary,--are you critic-bitten\n (For vipers kill, though dead) by some review,\n That you condemn these verses I have written,\n Because they tell no story, false or true?\n What, though no mice are caught by a young kitten,             _5\n May it not leap and play as grown cats do,\n Till its claws come?

Light the vest of flowing metre\n She wears; he, proud as dandy with his stays,\n Has hung upon his wiry limbs a dress\n Like King Lear's 'looped and windowed raggedness.'            _40\n\n 6.\n If you strip Peter, you will see a fellow\n Scorched by Hell's hyperequatorial climate\n Into a kind of a sulphureous yellow:\n A lean mark, hardly fit to fling a rhyme at;\n In shape a Scaramouch, in hue Othello.                        _45\n If you unveil my Witch, no priest nor primate\n Can shrive you of that sin,--if sin there be\n In love, when it becomes idolatry.\n\n\n THE WITCH OF ATLAS.\n\n 1.\n Before those cruel Twins, whom at one birth\n Incestuous Change bore to her father Time,                    _50\n Error and Truth, had hunted from the Earth\n All those bright natures which adorned its prime,\n And left us nothing to believe in, worth\n The pains of putting into learned rhyme,\n A lady-witch there lived on Atlas' mountain                   _55\n Within a cavern, by a secret fountain.\n\n 2.\n Her mother was one of the Atlantides:\n The all-beholding Sun had ne'er beholden\n In his wide voyage o'er continents and seas\n So fair a creature, as she lay enfolden                       _60\n In the warm shadow of her loveliness;--\n He kissed her with his beams, and made all golden\n The chamber of gray rock in which she lay--\n She, in that dream of joy, dissolved away.\n\n 3.\n 'Tis said, she first was changed into a vapour,               _65\n And then into a cloud, such clouds as flit,\n Like splendour-winged moths about a taper,\n Round the red west when the sun dies in it:\n And then into a meteor, such as caper\n On hill-tops when the moon is in a fit:                       _70\n Then, into one of those mysterious stars\n Which hide themselves between the Earth and Mars.\n\n 4.\n Ten times the Mother of the Months had bent\n Her bow beside the folding-star, and bidden\n With that bright sign the billows to indent                   _75\n The sea-deserted sand--like children chidden,\n At her command they ever came and went--\n Since in that cave a dewy splendour hidden\n Took shape and motion: with the living form\n Of this embodied Power, the cave grew warm.                   _80\n\n 5.\n A lovely lady garmented in light\n From her own beauty--deep her eyes, as are\n Two openings of unfathomable night\n Seen through a Temple's cloven roof--her hair\n Dark--the dim brain whirls dizzy with delight.                _85\n Picturing her form; her soft smiles shone afar,\n And her low voice was heard like love, and drew\n All living things towards this wonder new.\n\n 6.\n And first the spotted cameleopard came,\n And then the wise and fearless elephant;                      _90\n Then the sly serpent, in the golden flame\n Of his own volumes intervolved;--all gaunt\n And sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame.\n They drank before her at her sacred fount;\n And every beast of beating heart grew bold,                   _95\n Such gentleness and power even to behold.\n\n 7.\n The brinded lioness led forth her young,\n That she might teach them how they should forego\n Their inborn thirst of death; the pard unstrung\n His sinews at her feet, and sought to know                    _100\n With looks whose motions spoke without a tongue\n How he might be as gentle as the doe.\n The magic circle of her voice and eyes\n All savage natures did imparadise.\n\n 8.\n And old Silenus, shaking a green stick                        _105\n Of lilies, and the wood-gods in a crew\n Came, blithe, as in the olive copses thick\n Cicadae are, drunk with the noonday dew:\n And Dryope and Faunus followed quick,\n Teasing the God to sing them something new;                   _110\n Till in this cave they found the lady lone,\n Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.\n\n 9.\n And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there,\n And though none saw him,--through the adamant\n Of the deep mountains, through the trackless air,             _115\n And through those living spirits, like a want,\n He passed out of his everlasting lair\n Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,\n And felt that wondrous lady all alone,--\n And she felt him, upon her emerald throne.                    _120\n\n 10.\n And every nymph of stream and spreading tree,\n And every shepherdess of Ocean's flocks,\n Who drives her white waves over the green sea,\n And Ocean with the brine on his gray locks,\n And quaint Priapus with his company,                          _125\n All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocks\n Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth;--\n Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.\n\n 11.\n The herdsmen and the mountain maidens came,\n And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--                     _130\n Their spirits shook within them, as a flame\n Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:\n Pigmies, and Polyphemes, by many a name,\n Centaurs, and Satyrs, and such shapes as haunt\n Wet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,                _135\n Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed.\n\n 12.\n For she was beautiful--her beauty made\n The bright world dim, and everything beside\n Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:\n No thought of living spirit could abide,                      _140\n Which to her looks had ever been betrayed,\n On any object in the world so wide,\n On any hope within the circling skies,\n But on her form, and in her inmost eyes.\n\n 13.\n Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle                _145\n And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three\n Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle\n The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she\n As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle\n In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150\n And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--\n A shadow for the splendour of her love.\n\n 14.\n The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling\n Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,\n Which had the power all spirits of compelling,                _155\n Folded in cells of crystal silence there;\n Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling\n Will never die--yet ere we are aware,\n The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,\n And the regret they leave remains alone.                      _160\n\n 15.\n And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,\n Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,\n Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint\n With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.\n It was its work to bear to many a saint                       _165\n Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,\n Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,\n And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.\n\n 16.\n And odours in a kind of aviary\n Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170\n Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy\n Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;\n As bats at the wired window of a dairy,\n They beat their vans; and each was an adept,\n When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175\n To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.\n\n 17.\n And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might\n Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,\n And change eternal death into a night\n Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,               _180\n Could make their tears all wonder and delight,\n She in her crystal vials did closely keep:\n If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said\n The living were not envied of the dead.\n\n 18.\n Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185\n The works of some Saturnian Archimage,\n Which taught the expiations at whose price\n Men from the Gods might win that happy age\n Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;\n And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190\n Of gold and blood--till men should live and move\n Harmonious as the sacred stars above;\n\n 19.\n And how all things that seem untameable,\n Not to be checked and not to be confined,\n Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;                     _195\n Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,\n And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;\n And other scrolls whose writings did unbind\n The inmost lore of Love--let the profane\n Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.                     _200\n\n 20.\n And wondrous works of substances unknown,\n To which the enchantment of her father's power\n Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,\n Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;\n Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone              _205\n In their own golden beams--each like a flower,\n Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light\n Under a cypress in a starless night.\n\n 21.\n At first she lived alone in this wild home,\n And her own thoughts were each a minister,                    _210\n Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,\n Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,\n To work whatever purposes might come\n Into her mind; such power her mighty Sire\n Had girt them with, whether to fly or run,                    _215\n Through all the regions which he shines upon.\n\n 22.\n The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,\n Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,\n Offered to do her bidding through the seas,\n Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,                     _220\n And far beneath the matted roots of trees,\n And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,\n So they might live for ever in the light\n Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.\n\n 23.\n 'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;                   _225\n 'The fountains where the Naiades bedew\n Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;\n The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew\n Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;\n The boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        _230\n Will be consumed--the stubborn centre must\n Be scattered, like a cloud of summer dust.\n\n 24.\n 'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--\n If I must sigh to think that this shall be,\n If I must weep when the surviving Sun                         _235\n Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me\n To love you till your little race is run;\n I cannot die as ye must--over me\n Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell\n Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'--            _240\n\n 25.\n She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well\n Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,\n And every little circlet where they fell\n Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres\n And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245\n Of sobbing voices came upon her ears\n From those departing Forms, o'er the serene\n Of the white streams and of the forest green.\n\n 26.\n All day the wizard lady sate aloof,\n Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,                      _250\n Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;\n Or broidering the pictured poesy\n Of some high tale upon her growing woof,\n Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye\n In hues outshining heaven--and ever she                       _255\n Added some grace to the wrought poesy.\n\n 27.\n While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece\n Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;\n Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--\n Each flame of it is as a precious stone                       _260\n Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this\n Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.\n The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand\n She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.\n\n 28.\n This lady never slept, but lay in trance                      _265\n All night within the fountain--as in sleep.\n Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;\n Through the green splendour of the water deep\n She saw the constellations reel and dance\n Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep                     _270\n The tenour of her contemplations calm,\n With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.\n\n 29.\n And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended\n From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,\n She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275\n Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel\n Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,\n There yawned an inextinguishable well\n Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,\n And overflowing all the margin trim.                          _280\n\n 30.\n Within the which she lay when the fierce war\n Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor\n In many a mimic moon and bearded star\n O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker\n In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--                 _285\n And when the windless snow descended thicker\n Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came\n Melt on the surface of the level flame.\n\n 31.\n She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought\n For Venus, as the chariot of her star;                        _290\n But it was found too feeble to be fraught\n With all the ardours in that sphere which are,\n And so she sold it, and Apollo bought\n And gave it to this daughter: from a car\n Changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                  _295\n Which ever upon mortal stream did float.\n\n 32.\n And others say, that, when but three hours old,\n The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,\n And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,\n And like a horticultural adept,                               _300\n Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,\n And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept\n Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,\n And with his wings fanning it as it grew.\n\n 33.\n The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305\n Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began\n To turn the light and dew by inward power\n To its own substance; woven tracery ran\n Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er\n The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310\n Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion\n Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.\n\n 34.\n This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit\n A living spirit within all its frame,\n Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.                      _315\n Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,\n One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit--\n Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame--\n Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought,--\n In joyous expectation lay the boat.                           _320\n\n 35.\n Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow\n Together, tempering the repugnant mass\n With liquid love--all things together grow\n Through which the harmony of love can pass;\n And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--                  _325\n A living Image, which did far surpass\n In beauty that bright shape of vital stone\n Which drew the heart out of Pygmalion.\n\n 36.\n A sexless thing it was, and in its growth\n It seemed to have developed no defect                         _330\n Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--\n In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;\n The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,\n The countenance was such as might select\n Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335\n Imaging forth such perfect purity.\n\n 37.\n From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings,\n Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,\n Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,\n Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere:                        _340\n She led her creature to the boiling springs\n Where the light boat was moored, and said: 'Sit here!'\n And pointed to the prow, and took her seat\n Beside the rudder, with opposing feet.\n\n 38.\n And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,        _345\n Around their inland islets, and amid\n The panther-peopled forests whose shade cast\n Darkness and odours, and a pleasure hid\n In melancholy gloom, the pinnace passed;\n By many a star-surrounded pyramid                             _350\n Of icy crag cleaving the purple sky,\n And caverns yawning round unfathomably.\n\n 39.\n The silver noon into that winding dell,\n With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,\n Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;                    _355\n A green and glowing light, like that which drops\n From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,\n When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;\n Between the severed mountains lay on high,\n Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.                        _360\n\n 40.\n And ever as she went, the Image lay\n With folded wings and unawakened eyes;\n And o'er its gentle countenance did play\n The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,\n Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,                 _365\n And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs\n Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,\n They had aroused from that full heart and brain.\n\n 41.\n And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud\n Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:                      _370\n Now lingering on the pools, in which abode\n The calm and darkness of the deep content\n In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road\n Of white and dancing waters, all besprent\n With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat                  _375\n In such a shallow rapid could not float.\n\n 42.\n And down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver\n Their snow-like waters into golden air,\n Or under chasms unfathomable ever\n Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tear                  _380\n A subterranean portal for the river,\n It fled--the circling sunbows did upbear\n Its fall down the hoar precipice of spray,\n Lighting it far upon its lampless way.\n\n 43.\n And when the wizard lady would ascend                         _385\n The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,\n Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--\n She called 'Hermaphroditus!'--and the pale\n And heavy hue which slumber could extend\n Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale                        _390\n A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,\n Into the darkness of the stream did pass.\n\n 44.\n And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,\n With stars of fire spotting the stream below;\n And from above into the Sun's dominions                       _395\n Flinging a glory, like the golden glow\n In which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,\n All interwoven with fine feathery snow\n And moonlight splendour of intensest rime,\n With which frost paints the pines in winter time.             _400\n\n 45.\n And then it winnowed the Elysian air\n Which ever hung about that lady bright,\n With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,\n Like a star up the torrent of the night,\n Or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         _405\n Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,\n The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,\n Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.\n\n 46.\n The water flashed, like sunlight by the prow\n Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to Heaven;                   _410\n The still air seemed as if its waves did flow\n In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven\n The lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro:\n Beneath, the billows having vainly striven\n Indignant and impetuous, roared to feel                       _415\n The swift and steady motion of the keel.\n\n 47.\n Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,\n Or in the noon of interlunar night,\n The lady-witch in visions could not chain\n Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light                  _420\n Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain\n Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite;\n She to the Austral waters took her way,\n Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,--\n\n 48.\n Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,              _425\n Which rain could never bend, or whirl-blast shake,\n With the Antarctic constellations paven,\n Canopus and his crew, lay the Austral lake--\n There she would build herself a windless haven\n Out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                   _430\n The bastions of the storm, when through the sky\n The spirits of the tempest thundered by:\n\n 49.\n A haven beneath whose translucent floor\n The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,\n And around which the solid vapours hoar,                      _435\n Based on the level waters, to the sky\n Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore\n Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly\n Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,\n And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.                       _440\n\n 50.\n And whilst the outer lake beneath the lash\n Of the wind's scourge, foamed like a wounded thing,\n And the incessant hail with stony clash\n Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wing\n Of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                _445\n Looked like the wreck of some wind-wandering\n Fragment of inky thunder-smoke--this haven\n Was as a gem to copy Heaven engraven,--\n\n 51.\n On which that lady played her many pranks,\n Circling the image of a shooting star,                        _450\n Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks\n Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are,\n In her light boat; and many quips and cranks\n She played upon the water, till the car\n Of the late moon, like a sick matron wan,                     _455\n To journey from the misty east began.\n\n 52.\n And then she called out of the hollow turrets\n Of those high clouds, white, golden and vermilion,\n The armies of her ministering spirits--\n In mighty legions, million after million,                     _460\n They came, each troop emblazoning its merits\n On meteor flags;

she would often climb\n The steepest ladder of the crudded rack\n Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,\n And like Arion on the dolphin's back\n Ride singing through the shoreless air;--oft-time             _485\n Following the serpent lightning's winding track,\n She ran upon the platforms of the wind,\n And laughed to hear the fire-balls roar behind.\n\n 56.\n And sometimes to those streams of upper air\n Which whirl the earth in its diurnal round,                   _490\n She would ascend, and win the spirits there\n To let her join their chorus. Mortals found\n That on those days the sky was calm and fair,\n And mystic snatches of harmonious sound\n Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,                  _495\n And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.\n\n 57.\n But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,\n To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads\n Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep\n Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,                            _500\n Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,\n His waters on the plain: and crested heads\n Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,\n And many a vapour-belted pyramid.\n\n 58.\n By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,                             _505\n Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,\n Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,\n Or charioteering ghastly alligators,\n Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes\n Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510\n Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,\n Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.\n\n 59.\n And where within the surface of the river\n The shadows of the massy temples lie,\n And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515\n Like things which every cloud can doom to die,\n Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever\n The works of man pierced that serenest sky\n With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight\n To wander in the shadow of the night.                         _520\n\n 60.\n With motion like the spirit of that wind\n Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet\n Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.\n Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,\n Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined           _525\n With many a dark and subterranean street\n Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep\n She passed, observing mortals in their sleep.\n\n 61.\n A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see\n Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.                   _530\n Here lay two sister twins in infancy;\n There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;\n Within, two lovers linked innocently\n In their loose locks which over both did creep\n Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm                   _535\n Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.\n\n 62.\n But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,\n Not to be mirrored in a holy song--\n Distortions foul of supernatural awe,\n And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;                        _540\n And all the code of Custom's lawless law\n Written upon the brows of old and young:\n 'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife\n Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'\n\n 63.\n And little did the sight disturb her soul.--                  _545\n We, the weak mariners of that wide lake\n Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,\n Our course unpiloted and starless make\n O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--\n But she in the calm depths her way could take,                _550\n Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide\n Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.\n\n 64.\n And she saw princes couched under the glow\n Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court\n In dormitories ranged, row after row,                         _555\n She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--\n For all were educated to be so.--\n The peasants in their huts, and in the port\n The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,\n And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.            _560\n\n 65.\n And all the forms in which those spirits lay\n Were to her sight like the diaphanous\n Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array\n Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us\n Only their scorn of all concealment: they                     _565\n Move in the light of their own beauty thus.\n But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,\n And little thought a Witch was looking on them.\n\n 66.\n She, all those human figures breathing there,\n Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570\n The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,\n And often through a rude and worn disguise\n She saw the inner form most bright and fair--\n And then she had a charm of strange device,\n Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575\n Could make that spirit mingle with her own.\n\n 67.\n Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given\n For such a charm when Tithon became gray?\n Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven\n Wouldst thou have yielded, ere Proserpina                     _580\n Had half (oh! why not all?) the debt forgiven\n Which dear Adonis had been doomed to pay,\n To any witch who would have taught you it?\n The Heliad doth not know its value yet.\n\n 68.\n 'Tis said in after times her spirit free                      _585\n Knew what love was, and felt itself alone--\n But holy Dian could not chaster be\n Before she stooped to kiss Endymion,\n Than now this lady--like a sexless bee\n Tasting all blossoms, and confined to none,                   _590\n Among those mortal forms, the wizard-maiden\n Passed with an eye serene and heart unladen.\n\n 69.\n To those she saw most beautiful, she gave\n Strange panacea in a crystal bowl:--\n They drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave,            _595\n And lived thenceforward as if some control,\n Mightier than life, were in them; and the grave\n Of such, when death oppressed the weary soul,\n Was as a green and overarching bower\n Lit by the gems of many a starry flower.                      _600\n\n 70.\n For on the night when they were buried, she\n Restored the embalmers' ruining, and shook\n The light out of the funeral lamps, to be\n A mimic day within that deathy nook;\n And she unwound the woven imagery                             _605\n Of second childhood's swaddling bands, and took\n The coffin, its last cradle, from its niche,\n And threw it with contempt into a ditch.\n\n 71.\n And there the body lay, age after age.\n Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,               _610\n Like one asleep in a green hermitage,\n With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,\n And living in its dreams beyond the rage\n Of death or life; while they were still arraying\n In liveries ever new, the rapid, blind                        _615\n And fleeting generations of mankind.\n\n 72.\n And she would write strange dreams upon the brain\n Of those who were less beautiful, and make\n All harsh and crooked purposes more vain\n Than in the desert is the serpent's wake                      _620\n Which the sand covers--all his evil gain\n The miser in such dreams would rise and shake\n Into a beggar's lap;--the lying scribe\n Would his own lies betray without a bribe.\n\n 73.\n The priests would write an explanation full,                  _625\n Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,\n How the God Apis really was a bull,\n And nothing more; and bid the herald stick\n The same against the temple doors, and pull\n The old cant down; they licensed all to speak                 _630\n Whate'er they thought of hawks, and cats, and geese,\n By pastoral letters to each diocese.\n\n 74.\n The king would dress an ape up in his crown\n And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,\n And on the right hand of the sunlike throne                   _635\n Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeat\n The chatterings of the monkey.--Every one\n Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet\n Of their great Emperor, when the morning came,\n And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!                     _640\n\n 75.\n The soldiers dreamed that they were blacksmiths, and\n Walked out of quarters in somnambulism;\n Round the red anvils you might see them stand\n Like Cyclopses in Vulcan's sooty abysm,\n Beating their swords to ploughshares;--in a band              _645\n The gaolers sent those of the liberal schism\n Free through the streets of Memphis, much, I wis,\n To the annoyance of king Amasis.\n\n 76.\n And timid lovers who had been so coy,\n They hardly knew whether they loved or not,                   _650\n Would rise out of their rest, and take sweet joy,\n To the fulfilment of their inmost thought;\n And when next day the maiden and the boy\n Met one another, both, like sinners caught,\n Blushed at the thing which each believed was done             _655\n Only in fancy--till the tenth moon shone;\n\n 77.\n And then the Witch would let them take no ill:\n Of many thousand schemes which lovers find,\n The Witch found one,--and so they took their fill\n Of happiness in marriage warm and kind.                       _660\n Friends who, by practice of some envious skill,\n Were torn apart--a wide wound, mind from mind!--\n She did unite again with visions clear\n Of deep affection and of truth sincere.\n\n 80.\n These were the pranks she played among the cities             _665\n Of mortal men, and what she did to Sprites\n And Gods, entangling them in her sweet ditties\n To do her will, and show their subtle sleights,\n I will declare another time; for it is\n A tale more fit for the weird winter nights                   _670\n Than for these garish summer days, when we\n Scarcely believe much more than we can see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Witch of Atlas, by Percy Bysshe Shelley"}

As the play begins Nora and Cathleen receive word from the priest that a body, that may be their brother Michael, has washed up on shore in Donegal, the island farthest north of their home island of Inishmaan. Bartley is planning to sail to Connemara to sell a horse, and ignores Maurya's pleas to stay. He leaves gracefully. Maurya predicts that by nightfall she will have no living sons, and her daughters chide her for sending Bartley off with an ill word. Maurya goes after Bartley to bless his voyage, and Nora and Cathleen receive clothing from the drowned corpse that confirms it is their brother. Maurya returns home claiming to have seen the ghost of Michael riding behind Bartley and begins lamenting the loss of the men in her family to the sea, after which some villagers bring in the corpse of Bartley, who has fallen off his horse into the sea and drowned.\nThis speech of Maurya's is famous in Irish drama:\n(raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people around her) They're all gone now, and there isn't anything more the sea can do to me....

M. Synge\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt must have been on Synge's second visit to the Aran Islands that he\nhad the experience out of which was wrought what many believe to be his\ngreatest play. The scene of \"Riders to the Sea\" is laid in a cottage\non Inishmaan, the middle and most interesting island of the Aran group.\nWhile Synge was on Inishmaan, the story came to him of a man whose body\nhad been washed up on the far away coast of Donegal, and who, by reason\nof certain peculiarities of dress, was suspected to be from the island.\nIn due course, he was recognised as a native of Inishmaan, in exactly\nthe manner described in the play, and perhaps one of the most poignantly\nvivid passages in Synge's book on \"The Aran Islands\" relates the\nincident of his burial.\n\nThe other element in the story which Synge introduces into the play is\nequally true. Many tales of \"second sight\" are to be heard among Celtic\nraces. In fact, they are so common as to arouse little or no wonder in\nthe minds of the people. It is just such a tale, which there seems no\nvalid reason for doubting, that Synge heard, and that gave the title,\n\"Riders to the Sea\", to his play.\n\nIt is the dramatist's high distinction that he has simply taken the\nmaterials which lay ready to his hand, and by the power of sympathy\nwoven them, with little modification, into a tragedy which, for dramatic\nirony and noble pity, has no equal among its contemporaries. Great\ntragedy, it is frequently claimed with some show of justice, has\nperforce departed with the advance of modern life and its complicated\ntangle of interests and creature comforts. A highly developed\ncivilisation, with its attendant specialisation of culture, tends ever\nto lose sight of those elemental forces, those primal emotions, naked to\nwind and sky, which are the stuff from which great drama is wrought by\nthe artist, but which, as it would seem, are rapidly departing from us.\nIt is only in the far places, where solitary communion may be had with\nthe elements, that this dynamic life is still to be found continuously,\nand it is accordingly thither that the dramatist, who would deal with\nspiritual life disengaged from the environment of an intellectual maze,\nmust go for that experience which will beget in him inspiration for\nhis art. The Aran Islands from which Synge gained his inspiration are\nrapidly losing that sense of isolation and self-dependence, which has\nhitherto been their rare distinction, and which furnished the motivation\nfor Synge's masterpiece. Whether or not Synge finds a successor, it is\nnone the less true that in English dramatic literature \"Riders to the\nSea\" has an historic value which it would be difficult to over-estimate\nin its accomplishment and its possibilities. A writer in The Manchester\nGuardian shortly after Synge's death phrased it rightly when he wrote\nthat it is \"the tragic masterpiece of our language in our time; wherever\nit has been played in Europe from Galway to Prague, it has made the word\ntragedy mean something more profoundly stirring and cleansing to the\nspirit than it did.\"\n\nThe secret of the play's power is its capacity for standing afar off,\nand mingling, if we may say so, sympathy with relentlessness. There is a\nwonderful beauty of speech in the words of every character, wherein the\nlatent power of suggestion is almost unlimited. \"In the big world the\nold people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children,\nbut in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for\nthem that do be old.\" In the quavering rhythm of these words, there is\npoignantly present that quality of strangeness and remoteness in beauty\nwhich, as we are coming to realise, is the touchstone of Celtic\nliterary art. However, the very asceticism of the play has begotten a\ncorresponding power which lifts Synge's work far out of the current of\nthe Irish literary revival, and sets it high in a timeless atmosphere of\nuniversal action.\n\nIts characters live and die. It is their virtue in life to be lonely,\nand none but the lonely man in tragedy may be great. He dies, and then\nit is the virtue in life of the women mothers and wives and sisters to\nbe great in their loneliness, great as Maurya, the stricken mother, is\ngreat in her final word.\n\n\"Michael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the\nAlmighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards,\nand a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at\nall can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.\" The pity and\nthe terror of it all have brought a great peace, the peace that passeth\nunderstanding, and it is because the play holds this timeless peace\nafter the storm which has bowed down every character, that \"Riders to\nthe Sea\" may rightly take its place as the greatest modern tragedy in\nthe English tongue.\n\nEDWARD J.

Honor Lavelle\n\n     BARTLEY (her son)..........  W. G. Fay\n\n     CATHLEEN (her daughter)....  Sarah Allgood\n\n     NORA (a younger daughter)..  Emma Vernon\n\n     MEN AND WOMEN\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENE.\n\n--An Island off the West of Ireland. (Cottage kitchen, with nets,\noil-skins, spinning wheel, some new boards standing by the wall, etc.\nCathleen, a girl of about twenty, finishes kneading cake, and puts it\ndown in the pot-oven by the fire; then wipes her hands, and begins to\nspin at the wheel. NORA, a young girl, puts her head in at the door.)\n\n\nNORA [In a low voice.]\n\nWhere is she?\n\nCATHLEEN She's lying down, God help her, and may be sleeping, if she's\nable.\n\n[Nora comes in softly, and takes a bundle from under her shawl.]\n\nCATHLEEN [Spinning the wheel rapidly.]\n\nWhat is it you have?\n\nNORA The young priest is after bringing them. It's a shirt and a plain\nstocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.\n\n[Cathleen stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out to\nlisten.]\n\nNORA We're to find out if it's Michael's they are, some time herself\nwill be down looking by the sea.\n\nCATHLEEN How would they be Michael's, Nora. How would he go the length\nof that way to the far north?\n\nNORA The young priest says he's known the like of it. \"If it's Michael's\nthey are,\" says he, \"you can tell herself he's got a clean burial by the\ngrace of God, and if they're not his, let no one say a word about them,\nfor she'll be getting her death,\" says he, \"with crying and lamenting.\"\n\n[The door which Nora half closed is blown open by a gust of wind.]\n\nCATHLEEN [Looking out anxiously.]\n\nDid you ask him would he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to\nthe Galway fair?\n\nNORA \"I won't stop him,\" says he, \"but let you not be afraid. Herself\ndoes be saying prayers half through the night, and the Almighty God\nwon't leave her destitute,\" says he, \"with no son living.\"\n\nCATHLEEN Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?\n\nNORA Middling bad, God help us. There's a great roaring in the west, and\nit's worse it'll be getting when the tide's turned to the wind.\n\n[She goes over to the table with the bundle.]\n\nShall I open it now?\n\nCATHLEEN Maybe she'd wake up on us, and come in before we'd done.\n\n[Coming to the table.]\n\nIt's a long time we'll be, and the two of us crying.\n\nNORA [Goes to the inner door and listens.]\n\nShe's moving about on the bed. She'll be coming in a minute.\n\nCATHLEEN Give me the ladder, and I'll put them up in the turf-loft, the\nway she won't know of them at all, and maybe when the tide turns she'll\nbe going down to see would he be floating from the east.\n\n[They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney; Cathleen goes up\na few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. Maurya comes from the\ninner room.]\n\nMAURYA [Looking up at Cathleen and speaking querulously.]\n\nIsn't it turf enough you have for this day and evening?\n\nCATHLEEN There's a cake baking at the fire for a short space. [Throwing\ndown the turf] and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he goes\nto Connemara.\n\n[Nora picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven.]\n\nMAURYA [Sitting down on a stool at the fire.]\n\nHe won't go this day with the wind rising from the south and west. He\nwon't go this day, for the young priest will stop him surely.\n\nNORA He'll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen\nPheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go.\n\nMAURYA Where is he itself?\n\nNORA He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the\nweek, and I'm thinking it won't be long till he's here now, for the\ntide's turning at the green head, and the hooker' tacking from the east.\n\nCATHLEEN I hear some one passing the big stones.\n\nNORA [Looking out.]\n\nHe's coming now, and he's in a hurry.\n\nBARTLEY [Comes in and looks round the room. Speaking sadly and quietly.]\n\nWhere is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in Connemara?\n\nCATHLEEN [Coming down.]\n\nGive it to him, Nora; it's on a nail by the white boards. I hung it up\nthis morning, for the pig with the black feet was eating it.\n\nNORA [Giving him a rope.]\n\nIs that it, Bartley?\n\nMAURYA You'd do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by the boards\n[Bartley takes the rope]. It will be wanting in this place, I'm telling\nyou, if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning, or the next morning,\nor any morning in the week, for it's a deep grave we'll make him by the\ngrace of God.\n\nBARTLEY [Beginning to work with the rope.]\n\nI've no halter the way I can ride down on the mare, and I must go now\nquickly. This is the one boat going for two weeks or beyond it, and the\nfair will be a good fair for horses I heard them saying below.\n\nMAURYA It's a hard thing they'll be saying below if the body is washed\nup and there's no man in it to make the coffin, and I after giving a big\nprice for the finest white boards you'd find in Connemara.\n\n[She looks round at the boards.]\n\nBARTLEY How would it be washed up, and we after looking each day for\nnine days, and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and\nsouth?\n\nMAURYA If it wasn't found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and\nthere was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it\nwas a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the\nprice of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?\n\nBARTLEY [Working at the halter, to Cathleen.]\n\nLet you go down each day, and see the sheep aren't jumping in on the\nrye, and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if\nthere is a good price going.\n\nMAURYA How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?\n\nBARTLEY [To Cathleen]\n\nIf the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora\nget up weed enough for another cock for the kelp. It's hard set we'll be\nfrom this day with no one in it but one man to work.\n\nMAURYA It's hard set we'll be surely the day you're drownd'd with the\nrest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman\nlooking for the grave?\n\n[Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a\nnewer one of the same flannel.]\n\nBARTLEY [To Nora.]\n\nIs she coming to the pier?\n\nNORA [Looking out.] She's passing the green head and letting fall her\nsails.\n\nBARTLEY [Getting his purse and tobacco.]\n\nI'll have half an hour to go down, and you'll see me coming again in two\ndays, or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.\n\nMAURYA [Turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head.]\n\nIsn't it a hard and cruel man won't hear a word from an old woman, and\nshe holding him from the sea?\n\nCATHLEEN It's the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who\nwould listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?\n\nBARTLEY [Taking the halter.]\n\nI must go now quickly. I'll ride down on the red mare, and the gray\npony'll run behind me. . . The blessing of God on you.\n\n[He goes out.]\n\nMAURYA [Crying out as he is in the door.]\n\nHe's gone now, God spare us, and we'll not see him again. He's gone\nnow, and when the black night is falling I'll have no son left me in the\nworld.\n\nCATHLEEN Why wouldn't you give him your blessing and he looking round in\nthe door? Isn't it sorrow enough is on every one in this house without\nyour sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in\nhis ear?\n\n[Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without\nlooking round.]\n\nNORA [Turning towards her.]\n\nYou're taking away the turf from the cake.\n\nCATHLEEN [Crying out.]\n\nThe Son of God forgive us, Nora, we're after forgetting his bit of\nbread.\n\n[She comes over to the fire.]\n\nNORA And it's destroyed he'll be going till dark night, and he after\neating nothing since the sun went up.\n\nCATHLEEN [Turning the cake out of the oven.]\n\nIt's destroyed he'll be, surely. There's no sense left on any person in\na house where an old woman will be talking for ever.\n\n[Maurya sways herself on her stool.]\n\nCATHLEEN [Cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to\nMaurya.]\n\nLet you go down now to the spring well and give him this and he passing.\nYou'll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and you can say\n\"God speed you,\" the way he'll be easy in his mind.\n\nMAURYA [Taking the bread.]\n\nWill I be in it as soon as himself?\n\nCATHLEEN If you go now quickly.\n\nMAURYA [Standing up unsteadily.]\n\nIt's hard set I am to walk.\n\nCATHLEEN [Looking at her anxiously.]\n\nGive her the stick, Nora, or maybe she'll slip on the big stones.\n\nNORA What stick?\n\nCATHLEEN The stick Michael brought from Connemara.\n\nMAURYA [Taking a stick Nora gives her.]\n\nIn the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for\ntheir sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be\nleaving things behind for them that do be old.\n\n[She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder.]\n\nCATHLEEN Wait, Nora, maybe she'd turn back quickly. She's that sorry,\nGod help her, you wouldn't know the thing she'd do.\n\nNORA Is she gone round by the bush?\n\nCATHLEEN [Looking out.]\n\nShe's gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord knows when she'll be\nout of it again.\n\nNORA [Getting the bundle from the loft.]\n\nThe young priest said he'd be passing to-morrow, and we might go down\nand speak to him below if it's Michael's they are surely.\n\nCATHLEEN [Taking the bundle.]\n\nDid he say what way they were found?\n\nNORA [Coming down.]\n\n\"There were two men,\" says he, \"and they rowing round with poteen before\nthe cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them caught the body, and they\npassing the black cliffs of the north.\"\n\nCATHLEEN [Trying to open the bundle.]\n\nGive me a knife, Nora, the string's perished with the salt water, and\nthere's a black knot on it you wouldn't loosen in a week.\n\nNORA [Giving her a knife.]\n\nI've heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.\n\nCATHLEEN [Cutting the string.]\n\nIt is surely. There was a man in here a while ago--the man sold us that\nknife--and he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond, it\nwould be seven days you'd be in Donegal.\n\nNORA And what time would a man take, and he floating?\n\n[Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They look\nat them eagerly.]\n\nCATHLEEN [In a low voice.]\n\nThe Lord spare us, Nora! isn't it a queer hard thing to say if it's his\nthey are surely?\n\nNORA I'll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel\non the other [she looks through some clothes hanging in the corner.]\nIt's not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?\n\nCATHLEEN I'm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own\nshirt was heavy with the salt in it [pointing to the corner]. There's a\nbit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.\n\n[Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel.]\n\nCATHLEEN It's the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself aren't there\ngreat rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn't it many another man\nmay have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?\n\nNORA [Who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying\nout.]\n\nIt's Michael, Cathleen, it's Michael; God spare his soul, and what will\nherself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the sea?\n\nCATHLEEN [Taking the stocking.]\n\nIt's a plain stocking.\n\nNORA It's the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three\nscore stitches, and I dropped four of them.\n\nCATHLEEN [Counts the stitches.]\n\nIt's that number is in it [crying out.] Ah, Nora, isn't it a bitter\nthing to think of him floating that way to the far north, and no one to\nkeen him but the black hags that do be flying on the sea?\n\nNORA [Swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes.]\n\nAnd isn't it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who\nwas a great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain\nstocking?\n\nCATHLEEN [After an instant.]\n\nTell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.\n\nNORA [Looking out.]\n\nShe is, Cathleen. She's coming up to the door.\n\nCATHLEEN Put these things away before she'll come in. Maybe it's easier\nshe'll be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we won't let on\nwe've heard anything the time he's on the sea.\n\nNORA [Helping Cathleen to close the bundle.]\n\nWe'll put them here in the corner.\n\n[They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. Cathleen goes back to\nthe spinning-wheel.]\n\nNORA Will she see it was crying I was?\n\nCATHLEEN Keep your back to the door the way the light'll not be on you.\n\n[Nora sits down at the chimney corner, with her back to the door. Maurya\ncomes in very slowly, without looking at the girls, and goes over to her\nstool at the other side of the fire. The cloth with the bread is still\nin her hand. The girls look at each other, and Nora points to the bundle\nof bread.]\n\nCATHLEEN [After spinning for a moment.]\n\nYou didn't give him his bit of bread?\n\n[Maurya begins to keen softly, without turning round.]\n\nCATHLEEN Did you see him riding down?\n\n[Maurya goes on keening.]\n\nCATHLEEN [A little impatiently.]\n\nGod forgive you; isn't it a better thing to raise your voice and tell\nwhat you seen, than to be making lamentation for a thing that's done?\nDid you see Bartley, I'm saying to you?\n\nMAURYA [With a weak voice.]\n\nMy heart's broken from this day.\n\nCATHLEEN [As before.]\n\nDid you see Bartley?\n\nMAURYA I seen the fearfulest thing.\n\nCATHLEEN [Leaves her wheel and looks out.]\n\nGod forgive you; he's riding the mare now over the green head, and the\ngray pony behind him.\n\nMAURYA [Starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head and shows her\nwhite tossed hair. With a frightened voice.]\n\nThe gray pony behind him.\n\nCATHLEEN [Coming to the fire.]\n\nWhat is it ails you, at all?\n\nMAURYA [Speaking very slowly.]\n\nI've seen the fearfulest thing any person has seen, since the day Bride\nDara seen the dead man with the child in his arms.\n\nCATHLEEN AND NORA UAH.\n\n[They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire.]\n\nNORA Tell us what it is you seen.\n\nMAURYA I went down to the spring well, and I stood there saying a prayer\nto myself. Then Bartley came along, and he riding on the red mare with\nthe gray pony behind him [she puts up her hands, as if to hide something\nfrom her eyes.] The Son of God spare us, Nora!\n\nCATHLEEN What is it you seen.\n\nMAURYA I seen Michael himself.\n\nCATHLEEN [Speaking softly.]\n\nYou did not, mother; it wasn't Michael you seen, for his body is after\nbeing found in the far north, and he's got a clean burial by the grace\nof God.\n\nMAURYA [A little defiantly.]\n\nI'm after seeing him this day, and he riding and galloping. Bartley came\nfirst on the red mare; and I tried to say \"God speed you,\" but something\nchoked the words in my throat. He went by quickly; and \"the blessing of\nGod on you,\" says he, and I could say nothing. I looked up then, and\nI crying, at the gray pony, and there was Michael upon it--with fine\nclothes on him, and new shoes on his feet.\n\nCATHLEEN [Begins to keen.]\n\nIt's destroyed we are from this day. It's destroyed, surely.\n\nNORA Didn't the young priest say the Almighty God wouldn't leave her\ndestitute with no son living?\n\nMAURYA [In a low voice, but clearly.]\n\nIt's little the like of him knows of the sea. . . . Bartley will be\nlost now, and let you call in Eamon and make me a good coffin out of\nthe white boards, for I won't live after them. I've had a husband, and\na husband's father, and six sons in this house--six fine men, though\nit was a hard birth I had with every one of them and they coming to the\nworld--and some of them were found and some of them were not found, but\nthey're gone now the lot of them. . . There were Stephen, and Shawn,\nwere lost in the great wind, and found after in the Bay of Gregory of\nthe Golden Mouth, and carried up the two of them on the one plank, and\nin by that door.\n\n[She pauses for a moment, the girls start as if they heard something\nthrough the door that is half open behind them.]\n\nNORA [In a whisper.]\n\nDid you hear that, Cathleen? Did you hear a noise in the north-east?\n\nCATHLEEN [In a whisper.]\n\nThere's some one after crying out by the seashore.\n\nMAURYA [Continues without hearing anything.]\n\nThere was Sheamus and his father, and his own father again, were lost in\na dark night, and not a stick or sign was seen of them when the sun went\nup. There was Patch after was drowned out of a curagh that turned over.\nI was sitting here with Bartley, and he a baby, lying on my two knees,\nand I seen two women, and three women, and four women coming in, and\nthey crossing themselves, and not saying a word. I looked out then, and\nthere were men coming after them, and they holding a thing in the half\nof a red sail, and water dripping out of it--it was a dry day, Nora--and\nleaving a track to the door.\n\n[She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door. It\nopens softly and old women begin to come in, crossing themselves on the\nthreshold, and kneeling down in front of the stage with red petticoats\nover their heads.]\n\nMAURYA [Half in a dream, to Cathleen.]\n\nIs it Patch, or Michael, or what is it at all?\n\nCATHLEEN Michael is after being found in the far north, and when he is\nfound there how could he be here in this place?\n\nMAURYA There does be a power of young men floating round in the sea, and\nwhat way would they know if it was Michael they had, or another man like\nhim, for when a man is nine days in the sea, and the wind blowing, it's\nhard set his own mother would be to say what man was it.\n\nCATHLEEN It's Michael, God spare him, for they're after sending us a bit\nof his clothes from the far north.\n\n[She reaches out and hands Maurya the clothes that belonged to Michael.\nMaurya stands up slowly, and takes them into her hands. NORA looks out.]\n\nNORA They're carrying a thing among them and there's water dripping out\nof it and leaving a track by the big stones.\n\nCATHLEEN [In a whisper to the women who have come in.]\n\nIs it Bartley it is?\n\nONE OF THE WOMEN It is surely, God rest his soul.\n\n[Two younger women come in and pull out the table. Then men carry in the\nbody of Bartley, laid on a plank, with a bit of a sail over it, and lay\nit on the table.]\n\nCATHLEEN [To the women, as they are doing so.]\n\nWhat way was he drowned?\n\nONE OF THE WOMEN The gray pony knocked him into the sea, and he was\nwashed out where there is a great surf on the white rocks.\n\n[Maurya has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table. The women\nare keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow movement. Cathleen\nand Nora kneel at the other end of the table. The men kneel near the\ndoor.]\n\nMAURYA [Raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people\naround her.]\n\nThey're all gone now, and there isn't anything more the sea can do to\nme.... I'll have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind\nbreaks from the south, and you can hear the surf is in the east, and the\nsurf is in the west, making a great stir with the two noises, and they\nhitting one on the other. I'll have no call now to be going down and\ngetting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain, and I won't care\nwhat way the sea is when the other women will be keening. [To Nora]. Give\nme the Holy Water, Nora, there's a small sup still on the dresser.\n\n[Nora gives it to her.]\n\nMAURYA [Drops Michael's clothes across Bartley's feet, and sprinkles the\nHoly Water over him.]\n\nIt isn't that I haven't prayed for you, Bartley, to the Almighty God.\nIt isn't that I haven't said prayers in the dark night till you wouldn't\nknow what I'ld be saying; but it's a great rest I'll have now, and it's\ntime surely. It's a great rest I'll have now, and great sleeping in the\nlong nights after Samhain, if it's only a bit of wet flour we do have to\neat, and maybe a fish that would be stinking.\n\n[She kneels down again, crossing herself, and saying prayers under her\nbreath.]\n\nCATHLEEN [To an old man.]\n\nMaybe yourself and Eamon would make a coffin when the sun rises. We have\nfine white boards herself bought, God help her, thinking Michael would\nbe found, and I have a new cake you can eat while you'll be working.\n\nTHE OLD MAN [Looking at the boards.]\n\nAre there nails with them?\n\nCATHLEEN There are not, Colum; we didn't think of the nails.\n\nANOTHER MAN It's a great wonder she wouldn't think of the nails, and all\nthe coffins she's seen made already.\n\nCATHLEEN It's getting old she is, and broken.\n\n[Maurya stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of\nMichael's clothes beside the body, sprinkling them with the last of the\nHoly Water.]\n\nNORA [In a whisper to Cathleen.]\n\nShe's quiet now and easy; but the day Michael was drowned you could\nhear her crying out from this to the spring well. It's fonder she was of\nMichael, and would any one have thought that?\n\nCATHLEEN [Slowly and clearly.]\n\nAn old woman will be soon tired with anything she will do, and isn't it\nnine days herself is after crying and keening, and making great sorrow\nin the house?\n\nMAURYA [Puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table, and lays her\nhands together on Bartley's feet.]\n\nThey're all together this time, and the end is come. May the Almighty\nGod have mercy on Bartley's soul, and on Michael's soul, and on the\nsouls of Sheamus and Patch, and Stephen and Shawn (bending her head]);\nand may He have mercy on my soul, Nora, and on the soul of every one is\nleft living in the world.\n\n[She pauses, and the keen rises a little more loudly from the women,\nthen sinks away.]\n\nMAURYA [Continuing.]\n\nMichael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the\nAlmighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards,\nand a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all\ncan be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.\n\n[She kneels down again and the curtain falls slowly.]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Riders to the Sea, by J. M.

Intrigued by the ruins, the doctor tries unsuccessfully to enter the house night after night. Upon returning to the inn where he is staying, he questions the locals about the house. Finally several locals, including a lawyer and the innkeeper, explain the story of the manor.\nMadame de Merret, the late owner of the manor, forbid anyone from entering the house upon her death, be it workmen, visitors, or government officials, for 50 years. The lawyer was given the task, as well as funds, to ensure that her dying wish be accomplished.\nDr. Bianchon learned that Madame de Merret had a Spanish lover for a short period of her life. One day, Madame de Merret's husband returned early from a business trip when her lover was at the house. The lover hid himself in the closet, but the husband, hearing a sound, confronted his wife about the noise. Pressured by her suspicious husband, Madame de Merret swore upon a crucifix that there was no one in the closet, but threatened in turn to leave her husband if he were ever to open the closet out of suspicion. In response, Monsieur de Merret sent for a mason to wall up the closet, trapping the lover inside. Terrified, Madame de Merret passed along a message to the mason asking him to break a hole in the door when her husband was not looking before completely walling the closet off. The mason does that, and Madame de Merret catches a final glimpse of the maddened eyes of her lover through the hole. Once the closet was walled up completely, Madame and Monsieur de Merret stay in the bedroom for several days, listening to the muffled noise coming from the closet. Because of this traumatic experience, Madame de Merret declared her house off-limits upon her death.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK LA GRANDE BRETECHE ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by John Bickers, and Dagny\n\n\n\n\n\nLA GRANDE BRETECHE\n\n(Sequel to \"Another Study of Woman.\")\n\n\nBy Honore De Balzac\n\n\nTranslated by Ellen Marriage and Clara Bell\n\n\n\n\n\nLA GRANDE BRETECHE\n\n\n\"Ah! madame,\" replied the doctor, \"I have some appalling stories in my\ncollection. But each one has its proper hour in a conversation--you know\nthe pretty jest recorded by Chamfort, and said to the Duc de Fronsac:\n'Between your sally and the present moment lie ten bottles of\nchampagne.'\"\n\n\"But it is two in the morning, and the story of Rosina has prepared us,\"\nsaid the mistress of the house.\n\n\"Tell us, Monsieur Bianchon!\" was the cry on every side.\n\nThe obliging doctor bowed, and silence reigned.\n\n\"At about a hundred paces from Vendome, on the banks of the Loir,\" said\nhe, \"stands an old brown house, crowned with very high roofs, and so\ncompletely isolated that there is nothing near it, not even a fetid\ntannery or a squalid tavern, such as are commonly seen outside small\ntowns. In front of this house is a garden down to the river, where the\nbox shrubs, formerly clipped close to edge the walks, now straggle\nat their own will. A few willows, rooted in the stream, have grown\nup quickly like an enclosing fence, and half hide the house. The\nwild plants we call weeds have clothed the bank with their beautiful\nluxuriance. The fruit-trees, neglected for these ten years past,\nno longer bear a crop, and their suckers have formed a thicket. The\nespaliers are like a copse. The paths, once graveled, are overgrown with\npurslane; but, to be accurate there is no trace of a path.\n\n\"Looking down from the hilltop, to which cling the ruins of the old\ncastle of the Dukes of Vendome, the only spot whence the eye can\nsee into this enclosure, we think that at a time, difficult now to\ndetermine, this spot of earth must have been the joy of some country\ngentleman devoted to roses and tulips, in a word, to horticulture, but\nabove all a lover of choice fruit. An arbor is visible, or rather\nthe wreck of an arbor, and under it a table still stands not entirely\ndestroyed by time. At the aspect of this garden that is no more, the\nnegative joys of the peaceful life of the provinces may be divined as we\ndivine the history of a worthy tradesman when we read the epitaph on his\ntomb. To complete the mournful and tender impressions which seize the\nsoul, on one of the walls there is a sundial graced with this homely\nChristian motto, '_Ultimam cogita_.'\n\n\"The roof of this house is dreadfully dilapidated; the outside shutters\nare always closed; the balconies are hung with swallows' nests; the\ndoors are for ever shut. Straggling grasses have outlined the flagstones\nof the steps with green; the ironwork is rusty. Moon and sun, winter,\nsummer, and snow have eaten into the wood, warped the boards, peeled\noff the paint. The dreary silence is broken only by birds and cats,\npolecats, rats, and mice, free to scamper round, and fight, and eat each\nother. An invisible hand has written over it all: 'Mystery.'\n\n\"If, prompted by curiosity, you go to look at this house from the\nstreet, you will see a large gate, with a round-arched top; the children\nhave made many holes in it. I learned later that this door had been\nblocked for ten years. Through these irregular breaches you will see\nthat the side towards the courtyard is in perfect harmony with the side\ntowards the garden. The same ruin prevails. Tufts of weeds outline\nthe paving-stones; the walls are scored by enormous cracks, and the\nblackened coping is laced with a thousand festoons of pellitory. The\nstone steps are disjointed; the bell-cord is rotten; the gutter-spouts\nbroken. What fire from heaven could have fallen there? By what decree\nhas salt been sown on this dwelling? Has God been mocked here? Or was\nFrance betrayed? These are the questions we ask ourselves. Reptiles\ncrawl over it, but give no reply. This empty and deserted house is a\nvast enigma of which the answer is known to none.\n\n\"It was formerly a little domain, held in fief, and is known as La\nGrande Breteche. During my stay at Vendome, where Despleins had left me\nin charge of a rich patient, the sight of this strange dwelling became\none of my keenest pleasures. Was it not far better than a ruin? Certain\nmemories of indisputable authenticity attach themselves to a ruin; but\nthis house, still standing, though being slowly destroyed by an avenging\nhand, contained a secret, an unrevealed thought. At the very least,\nit testified to a caprice. More than once in the evening I boarded the\nhedge, run wild, which surrounded the enclosure. I braved scratches, I\ngot into this ownerless garden, this plot which was no longer public or\nprivate; I lingered there for hours gazing at the disorder. I would not,\nas the price of the story to which this strange scene no doubt was due,\nhave asked a single question of any gossiping native. On that spot I\nwove delightful romances, and abandoned myself to little debauches of\nmelancholy which enchanted me. If I had known the reason--perhaps quite\ncommonplace--of this neglect, I should have lost the unwritten poetry\nwhich intoxicated me. To me this refuge represented the most various\nphases of human life, shadowed by misfortune; sometimes the peace of the\ngraveyard without the dead, who speak in the language of epitaphs; one\nday I saw in it the home of lepers; another, the house of the Atridae;\nbut, above all, I found there provincial life, with its contemplative\nideas, its hour-glass existence. I often wept there, I never laughed.\n\n\"More than once I felt involuntary terrors as I heard overhead the dull\nhum of the wings of some hurrying wood-pigeon. The earth is dank; you\nmust be on the watch for lizards, vipers, and frogs, wandering about\nwith the wild freedom of nature; above all, you must have no fear\nof cold, for in a few moments you feel an icy cloak settle on your\nshoulders, like the Commendatore's hand on Don Giovanni's neck.\n\n\"One evening I felt a shudder; the wind had turned an old rusty\nweathercock, and the creaking sounded like a cry from the house, at\nthe very moment when I was finishing a gloomy drama to account for\nthis monumental embodiment of woe. I returned to my inn, lost in gloomy\nthoughts. When I had supped, the hostess came into my room with an air\nof mystery, and said, 'Monsieur, here is Monsieur Regnault.'\n\n\"'Who is Monsieur Regnault?'\n\n\"'What, sir, do you not know Monsieur Regnault?--Well, that's odd,' said\nshe, leaving the room.\n\n\"On a sudden I saw a man appear, tall, slim, dressed in black, hat\nin hand, who came in like a ram ready to butt his opponent, showing a\nreceding forehead, a small pointed head, and a colorless face of the hue\nof a glass of dirty water. You would have taken him for an usher. The\nstranger wore an old coat, much worn at the seams; but he had a diamond\nin his shirt frill, and gold rings in his ears.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said I, 'whom have I the honor of addressing?'--He took a\nchair, placed himself in front of my fire, put his hat on my table,\nand answered while he rubbed his hands: 'Dear me, it is very\ncold.--Monsieur, I am Monsieur Regnault.'\n\n\"I was encouraging myself by saying to myself, '_Il bondo cani!_ Seek!'\n\n\"'I am,' he went on, 'notary at Vendome.'\n\n\"'I am delighted to hear it, monsieur,' I exclaimed. 'But I am not in a\nposition to make a will for reasons best known to myself.'\n\n\"'One moment!' said he, holding up his hand as though to gain silence.\n'Allow me, monsieur, allow me! I am informed that you sometimes go to\nwalk in the garden of la Grande Breteche.'\n\n\"'Yes, monsieur.'\n\n\"'One moment!' said he, repeating his gesture. 'That constitutes a\nmisdemeanor. Monsieur, as executor under the will of the late Comtesse\nde Merret, I come in her name to beg you to discontinue the practice.\nOne moment! I am not a Turk, and do not wish to make a crime of it. And\nbesides, you are free to be ignorant of the circumstances which\ncompel me to leave the finest mansion in Vendome to fall into ruin.\nNevertheless, monsieur, you must be a man of education, and you should\nknow that the laws forbid, under heavy penalties, any trespass on\nenclosed property. A hedge is the same as a wall. But, the state in\nwhich the place is left may be an excuse for your curiosity. For my\npart, I should be quite content to make you free to come and go in the\nhouse; but being bound to respect the will of the testatrix, I have\nthe honor, monsieur, to beg that you will go into the garden no more.\nI myself, monsieur, since the will was read, have never set foot in the\nhouse, which, as I had the honor of informing you, is part of the estate\nof the late Madame de Merret. We have done nothing there but verify the\nnumber of doors and windows to assess the taxes I have to pay annually\nout of the funds left for that purpose by the late Madame de Merret. Ah!\nmy dear sir, her will made a great commotion in the town.'\n\n\"The good man paused to blow his nose. I respected his volubility,\nperfectly understanding that the administration of Madame de Merret's\nestate had been the most important event of his life, his reputation,\nhis glory, his Restoration. As I was forced to bid farewell to my\nbeautiful reveries and romances, I was to reject learning the truth on\nofficial authority.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said I, 'would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you the\nreasons for such eccentricity?'\n\n\"At these words an expression, which revealed all the pleasure which\nmen feel who are accustomed to ride a hobby, overspread the lawyer's\ncountenance. He pulled up the collar of his shirt with an air, took out\nhis snuffbox, opened it, and offered me a pinch; on my refusing, he took\na large one. He was happy! A man who has no hobby does not know all\nthe good to be got out of life. A hobby is the happy medium between a\npassion and a monomania. At this moment I understood the whole bearing\nof Sterne's charming passion, and had a perfect idea of the delight with\nwhich my uncle Toby, encouraged by Trim, bestrode his hobby-horse.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said Monsieur Regnault, 'I was head-clerk in Monsieur\nRoguin's office, in Paris. A first-rate house, which you may have heard\nmentioned? No! An unfortunate bankruptcy made it famous.--Not having\nmoney enough to purchase a practice in Paris at the price to which they\nwere run up in 1816, I came here and bought my predecessor's business.\nI had relations in Vendome; among others, a wealthy aunt, who allowed\nme to marry her daughter.--Monsieur,' he went on after a little pause,\n'three months after being licensed by the Keeper of the Seals, one\nevening, as I was going to bed--it was before my marriage--I was sent\nfor by Madame la Comtesse de Merret, to her Chateau of Merret. Her maid,\na good girl, who is now a servant in this inn, was waiting at my door\nwith the Countess' own carriage. Ah! one moment! I ought to tell you\nthat Monsieur le Comte de Merret had gone to Paris to die two months\nbefore I came here. He came to a miserable end, flinging himself into\nevery kind of dissipation. You understand?\n\n\"'On the day when he left, Madame la Comtesse had quitted la Grand\nBreteche, having dismantled it. Some people even say that she had\nburnt all the furniture, the hangings--in short, all the chattels and\nfurniture whatever used in furnishing the premises now let by the\nsaid M.--(Dear, what am I saying? I beg your pardon, I thought I was\ndictating a lease.)--In short, that she burnt everything in the meadow\nat Merret. Have you been to Merret, monsieur?--No,' said he, answering\nhimself, 'Ah, it is a very fine place.'\n\n\"'For about three months previously,' he went on, with a jerk of his\nhead, 'the Count and Countess had lived in a very eccentric way; they\nadmitted no visitors; Madame lived on the ground-floor, and Monsieur on\nthe first floor. When the Countess was left alone, she was never seen\nexcepting at church. Subsequently, at home, at the chateau, she refused\nto see the friends, whether gentlemen or ladies, who went to call on\nher. She was already very much altered when she left la Grande Breteche\nto go to Merret. That dear lady--I say dear lady, for it was she who\ngave me this diamond, but indeed I saw her but once--that kind lady was\nvery ill; she had, no doubt, given up all hope, for she died without\nchoosing to send for a doctor; indeed, many of our ladies fancied she\nwas not quite right in her head. Well, sir, my curiosity was strangely\nexcited by hearing that Madame de Merret had need of my services. Nor\nwas I the only person who took an interest in the affair. That very\nnight, though it was already late, all the town knew that I was going to\nMerret.\n\n\"'The waiting-woman replied but vaguely to the questions I asked her on\nthe way; nevertheless, she told me that her mistress had received the\nSacrament in the course of the day at the hands of the Cure of Merret,\nand seemed unlikely to live through the night. It was about eleven when\nI reached the chateau. I went up the great staircase. After crossing\nsome large, lofty, dark rooms, diabolically cold and damp, I reached the\nstate bedroom where the Countess lay. From the rumors that were current\nconcerning this lady (monsieur, I should never end if I were to repeat\nall the tales that were told about her), I had imagined her a coquette.\nImagine, then, that I had great difficulty in seeing her in the great\nbed where she was lying. To be sure, to light this enormous room, with\nold-fashioned heavy cornices, and so thick with dust that merely to see\nit was enough to make you sneeze, she had only an old Argand lamp. Ah!\nbut you have not been to Merret. Well, the bed is one of those old world\nbeds, with a high tester hung with flowered chintz. A small table stood\nby the bed, on which I saw an \"Imitation of Christ,\" which, by the\nway, I bought for my wife, as well as the lamp. There were also a deep\narmchair for her confidential maid, and two small chairs. There was no\nfire. That was all the furniture, not enough to fill ten lines in an\ninventory.\n\n\"'My dear sir, if you had seen, as I then saw, that vast room, papered\nand hung with brown, you would have felt yourself transported into a\nscene of a romance. It was icy, nay more, funereal,' and he lifted his\nhand with a theatrical gesture and paused.\n\n\"'By dint of seeking, as I approached the bed, at last I saw Madame de\nMerret, under the glimmer of the lamp, which fell on the pillows.\nHer face was as yellow as wax, and as narrow as two folded hands. The\nCountess had a lace cap showing her abundant hair, but as white as linen\nthread. She was sitting up in bed, and seemed to keep upright with\ngreat difficulty. Her large black eyes, dimmed by fever, no doubt,\nand half-dead already, hardly moved under the bony arch of her\neyebrows.--There,' he added, pointing to his own brow. 'Her forehead was\nclammy; her fleshless hands were like bones covered with soft skin;\nthe veins and muscles were perfectly visible. She must have been very\nhandsome; but at this moment I was startled into an indescribable\nemotion at the sight. Never, said those who wrapped her in her shroud,\nhad any living creature been so emaciated and lived. In short, it was\nawful to behold! Sickness so consumed that woman, that she was no more\nthan a phantom. Her lips, which were pale violet, seemed to me not to\nmove when she spoke to me.\n\n\"'Though my profession has familiarized me with such spectacles, by\ncalling me not infrequently to the bedside of the dying to record their\nlast wishes, I confess that families in tears and the agonies I have\nseen were as nothing in comparison with this lonely and silent woman in\nher vast chateau. I heard not the least sound, I did not perceive the\nmovement which the sufferer's breathing ought to have given to the\nsheets that covered her, and I stood motionless, absorbed in looking at\nher in a sort of stupor. In fancy I am there still. At last her large\neyes moved; she tried to raise her right hand, but it fell back on the\nbed, and she uttered these words, which came like a breath, for her\nvoice was no longer a voice: \"I have waited for you with the greatest\nimpatience.\" A bright flush rose to her cheeks. It was a great effort to\nher to speak.\n\n\"'\"Madame,\" I began. She signed to me to be silent. At that moment\nthe old housekeeper rose and said in my ear, \"Do not speak; Madame la\nComtesse is not in a state to bear the slightest noise, and what you say\nmight agitate her.\"\n\n\"'I sat down. A few instants after, Madame de Merret collected all her\nremaining strength to move her right hand, and slipped it, not without\ninfinite difficulty, under the bolster; she then paused a moment. With\na last effort she withdrew her hand; and when she brought out a sealed\npaper, drops of perspiration rolled from her brow. \"I place my will in\nyour hands--Oh! God! Oh!\" and that was all. She clutched a crucifix that\nlay on the bed, lifted it hastily to her lips, and died.\n\n\"'The expression of her eyes still makes me shudder as I think of it.\nShe must have suffered much! There was joy in her last glance, and it\nremained stamped on her dead eyes.\n\n\"'I brought away the will, and when it was opened I found that Madame de\nMerret had appointed me her executor. She left the whole of her property\nto the hospital at Vendome excepting a few legacies. But these were her\ninstructions as relating to la Grande Breteche: She ordered me to leave\nthe place, for fifty years counting from the day of her death, in the\nstate in which it might be at the time of her death, forbidding any one,\nwhoever he might be, to enter the apartments, prohibiting any repairs\nwhatever, and even settling a salary to pay watchmen if it were needful\nto secure the absolute fulfilment of her intentions. At the expiration\nof that term, if the will of the testatrix has been duly carried out,\nthe house is to become the property of my heirs, for, as you know, a\nnotary cannot take a bequest. Otherwise la Grande Breteche reverts to\nthe heirs-at-law, but on condition of fulfilling certain conditions\nset forth in a codicil to the will, which is not to be opened till\nthe expiration of the said term of fifty years. The will has not been\ndisputed, so----' And without finishing his sentence, the lanky notary\nlooked at me with an air of triumph; I made him quite happy by offering\nhim my congratulations.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' I said in conclusion, 'you have so vividly impressed\nme that I fancy I see the dying woman whiter than her sheets; her\nglittering eyes frighten me; I shall dream of her to-night.--But you\nmust have formed some idea as to the instructions contained in that\nextraordinary will.'\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said he, with comical reticence, 'I never allow myself\nto criticise the conduct of a person who honors me with the gift of a\ndiamond.'\n\n\"However, I soon loosened the tongue of the discreet notary of Vendome,\nwho communicated to me, not without long digressions, the opinions of\nthe deep politicians of both sexes whose judgments are law in Vendome.\nBut these opinions were so contradictory, so diffuse, that I was\nnear falling asleep in spite of the interest I felt in this authentic\nhistory. The notary's ponderous voice and monotonous accent, accustomed\nno doubt to listen to himself and to make himself listened to by his\nclients or fellow-townsmen, were too much for my curiosity. Happily, he\nsoon went away.\n\n\"'Ah, ha, monsieur,' said he on the stairs, 'a good many persons would\nbe glad to live five-and-forty years longer; but--one moment!' and he\nlaid the first finger of his right hand to his nostril with a cunning\nlook, as much as to say, 'Mark my words!--To last as long as that--as\nlong as that,' said he, 'you must not be past sixty now.'\n\n\"I closed my door, having been roused from my apathy by this last\nspeech, which the notary thought very funny; then I sat down in my\narmchair, with my feet on the fire-dogs. I had lost myself in a romance\n_a la_ Radcliffe, constructed on the juridical base given me by Monsieur\nRegnault, when the door, opened by a woman's cautious hand, turned on\nthe hinges. I saw my landlady come in, a buxom, florid dame, always\ngood-humored, who had missed her calling in life. She was a Fleming, who\nought to have seen the light in a picture by Teniers.\n\n\"'Well, monsieur,' said she, 'Monsieur Regnault has no doubt been giving\nyou his history of la Grande Breteche?'\n\n\"'Yes, Madame Lepas.'\n\n\"'And what did he tell you?'\n\n\"I repeated in a few words the creepy and sinister story of Madame de\nMerret. At each sentence my hostess put her head forward, looking at\nme with an innkeeper's keen scrutiny, a happy compromise between the\ninstinct of a police constable, the astuteness of a spy, and the cunning\nof a dealer.\n\n\"'My good Madame Lepas,' said I as I ended, 'you seem to know more about\nit. Heh? If not, why have you come up to me?'\n\n\"'On my word, as an honest woman----'\n\n\"'Do not swear; your eyes are big with a secret. You knew Monsieur de\nMerret; what sort of man was he?'\n\n\"'Monsieur de Merret--well, you see he was a man you never could see\nthe top of, he was so tall! A very good gentleman, from Picardy, and who\nhad, as we say, his head close to his cap. He paid for everything down,\nso as never to have difficulties with any one. He was hot-tempered, you\nsee! All our ladies liked him very much.'\n\n\"'Because he was hot-tempered?' I asked her.\n\n\"'Well, may be,' said she; 'and you may suppose, sir, that a man had to\nhave something to show for a figurehead before he could marry Madame de\nMerret, who, without any reflection on others, was the handsomest and\nrichest heiress in our parts. She had about twenty thousand francs\na year. All the town was at the wedding; the bride was pretty and\nsweet-looking, quite a gem of a woman. Oh, they were a handsome couple\nin their day!'\n\n\"'And were they happy together?'\n\n\"'Hm, hm! so-so--so far as can be guessed, for, as you may suppose, we\nof the common sort were not hail-fellow-well-met with them.--Madame de\nMerret was a kind woman and very pleasant, who had no doubt sometimes to\nput up with her husband's tantrums. But though he was rather haughty, we\nwere fond of him. After all, it was his place to behave so. When a man\nis a born nobleman, you see----'\n\n\"'Still, there must have been some catastrophe for Monsieur and Madame\nde Merret to part so violently?'\n\n\"'I did not say there was any catastrophe, sir. I know nothing about\nit.'\n\n\"'Indeed. Well, now, I am sure you know everything.'\n\n\"'Well, sir, I will tell you the whole story.--When I saw Monsieur\nRegnault go up to see you, it struck me that he would speak to you about\nMadame de Merret as having to do with la Grande Breteche. That put it\ninto my head to ask your advice, sir, seeming to me that you are a\nman of good judgment and incapable of playing a poor woman like me\nfalse--for I never did any one a wrong, and yet I am tormented by my\nconscience. Up to now I have never dared to say a word to the people of\nthese parts; they are all chatter-mags, with tongues like knives. And\nnever till now, sir, have I had any traveler here who stayed so long in\nthe inn as you have, and to whom I could tell the history of the fifteen\nthousand francs----'\n\n\"'My dear Madame Lepas, if there is anything in your story of a nature\nto compromise me,' I said, interrupting the flow of her words, 'I would\nnot hear it for all the world.'\n\n\"'You need have no fears,' said she; 'you will see.'\n\n\"Her eagerness made me suspect that I was not the only person to whom\nmy worthy landlady had communicated the secret of which I was to be the\nsole possessor, but I listened.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said she, 'when the Emperor sent the Spaniards here,\nprisoners of war and others, I was required to lodge at the charge\nof the Government a young Spaniard sent to Vendome on parole.\nNotwithstanding his parole, he had to show himself every day to the\nsub-prefect. He was a Spanish grandee--neither more nor less. He had\na name in _os_ and _dia_, something like Bagos de Feredia. I wrote his\nname down in my books, and you may see it if you like. Ah! he was a\nhandsome young fellow for a Spaniard, who are all ugly they say. He was\nnot more than five feet two or three in height, but so well made; and he\nhad little hands that he kept so beautifully! Ah! you should have\nseen them. He had as many brushes for his hands as a woman has for her\ntoilet. He had thick, black hair, a flame in his eye, a somewhat coppery\ncomplexion, but which I admired all the same. He wore the finest linen\nI have ever seen, though I have had princesses to lodge here, and, among\nothers, General Bertrand, the Duc and Duchesse d'Abrantes, Monsieur\nDescazes, and the King of Spain. He did not eat much, but he had such\npolite and amiable ways that it was impossible to owe him a grudge for\nthat. Oh! I was very fond of him, though he did not say four words to me\nin a day, and it was impossible to have the least bit of talk with him;\nif he was spoken to, he did not answer; it is a way, a mania they all\nhave, it would seem.\n\n\"'He read his breviary like a priest, and went to mass and all the\nservices quite regularly. And where did he post himself?--we found this\nout later.--Within two yards of Madame de Merret's chapel. As he took\nthat place the very first time he entered the church, no one imagined\nthat there was any purpose in it. Besides, he never raised his nose\nabove his book, poor young man! And then, monsieur, of an evening he\nwent for a walk on the hill among the ruins of the old castle. It was\nhis only amusement, poor man; it reminded him of his native land. They\nsay that Spain is all hills!\n\n\"'One evening, a few days after he was sent here, he was out very late.\nI was rather uneasy when he did not come in till just on the stroke of\nmidnight; but we all got used to his whims; he took the key of the door,\nand we never sat up for him. He lived in a house belonging to us in the\nRue des Casernes. Well, then, one of our stable-boys told us one evening\nthat, going down to wash the horses in the river, he fancied he had seen\nthe Spanish Grandee swimming some little way off, just like a fish. When\nhe came in, I told him to be careful of the weeds, and he seemed put out\nat having been seen in the water.\n\n\"'At last, monsieur, one day, or rather one morning, we did not find\nhim in his room; he had not come back. By hunting through his things, I\nfound a written paper in the drawer of his table, with fifty pieces of\nSpanish gold of the kind they call doubloons, worth about five thousand\nfrancs; and in a little sealed box ten thousand francs worth of\ndiamonds. The paper said that in case he should not return, he left us\nthis money and these diamonds in trust to found masses to thank God for\nhis escape and for his salvation.\n\n\"'At that time I still had my husband, who ran off in search of him.\nAnd this is the queer part of the story: he brought back the Spaniard's\nclothes, which he had found under a big stone on a sort of breakwater\nalong the river bank, nearly opposite la Grande Breteche. My husband\nwent so early that no one saw him. After reading the letter, he burnt\nthe clothes, and, in obedience to Count Feredia's wish, we announced\nthat he had escaped.\n\n\"'The sub-prefect set all the constabulary at his heels; but, pshaw! he\nwas never caught. Lepas believed that the Spaniard had drowned himself.\nI, sir, have never thought so; I believe, on the contrary, that he had\nsomething to do with the business about Madame de Merret, seeing that\nRosalie told me that the crucifix her mistress was so fond of that she\nhad it buried with her, was made of ebony and silver; now in the early\ndays of his stay here, Monsieur Feredia had one of ebony and silver\nwhich I never saw later.--And now, monsieur, do not you say that I need\nhave no remorse about the Spaniard's fifteen thousand francs? Are they\nnot really and truly mine?'\n\n\"'Certainly.--But have you never tried to question Rosalie?' said I.\n\n\"'Oh, to be sure I have, sir. But what is to be done? That girl is like\na wall. She knows something, but it is impossible to make her talk.'\n\n\"After chatting with me for a few minutes, my hostess left me a prey\nto vague and sinister thoughts, to romantic curiosity, and a religious\ndread, not unlike the deep emotion which comes upon us when we go into a\ndark church at night and discern a feeble light glimmering under a lofty\nvault--a dim figure glides across--the sweep of a gown or of a priest's\ncassock is audible--and we shiver! La Grande Breteche, with its rank\ngrasses, its shuttered windows, its rusty iron-work, its locked doors,\nits deserted rooms, suddenly rose before me in fantastic vividness. I\ntried to get into the mysterious dwelling to search out the heart of\nthis solemn story, this drama which had killed three persons.\n\n\"Rosalie became in my eyes the most interesting being in Vendome. As\nI studied her, I detected signs of an inmost thought, in spite of the\nblooming health that glowed in her dimpled face. There was in her soul\nsome element of ruth or of hope; her manner suggested a secret, like\nthe expression of devout souls who pray in excess, or of a girl who has\nkilled her child and for ever hears its last cry. Nevertheless, she was\nsimple and clumsy in her ways; her vacant smile had nothing criminal\nin it, and you would have pronounced her innocent only from seeing the\nlarge red and blue checked kerchief that covered her stalwart bust,\ntucked into the tight-laced bodice of a lilac- and white-striped gown.\n'No,' said I to myself, 'I will not quit Vendome without knowing the\nwhole history of la Grande Breteche. To achieve this end, I will make\nlove to Rosalie if it proves necessary.'\n\n\"'Rosalie!' said I one evening.\n\n\"'Your servant, sir?'\n\n\"'You are not married?' She started a little.\n\n\"'Oh! there is no lack of men if ever I take a fancy to be miserable!'\nshe replied, laughing. She got over her agitation at once; for every\nwoman, from the highest lady to the inn-servant inclusive, has a native\npresence of mind.\n\n\"'Yes; you are fresh and good-looking enough never to lack lovers! But\ntell me, Rosalie, why did you become an inn-servant on leaving Madame de\nMerret? Did she not leave you some little annuity?'\n\n\"'Oh yes, sir. But my place here is the best in all the town of\nVendome.'\n\n\"This reply was such an one as judges and attorneys call evasive.\nRosalie, as it seemed to me, held in this romantic affair the place of\nthe middle square of the chess-board: she was at the very centre of the\ninterest and of the truth; she appeared to me to be tied into the knot\nof it. It was not a case for ordinary love-making; this girl contained\nthe last chapter of a romance, and from that moment all my attentions\nwere devoted to Rosalie. By dint of studying the girl, I observed in\nher, as in every woman whom we make our ruling thought, a variety of\ngood qualities; she was clean and neat; she was handsome, I need not\nsay; she soon was possessed of every charm that desire can lend to a\nwoman in whatever rank of life. A fortnight after the notary's visit,\none evening, or rather one morning, in the small hours, I said to\nRosalie:\n\n\"'Come, tell me all you know about Madame de Merret.'\n\n\"'Oh!' she said, 'I will tell you; but keep the secret carefully.'\n\n\"'All right, my child; I will keep all your secrets with a thief's\nhonor, which is the most loyal known.'\n\n\"'If it is all the same to you,' said she, 'I would rather it should be\nwith your own.'\n\n\"Thereupon she set her head-kerchief straight, and settled herself to\ntell the tale; for there is no doubt a particular attitude of confidence\nand security is necessary to the telling of a narrative. The best tales\nare told at a certain hour--just as we are all here at table. No one\never told a story well standing up, or fasting.\n\n\"If I were to reproduce exactly Rosalie's diffuse eloquence, a whole\nvolume would scarcely contain it. Now, as the event of which she gave me\na confused account stands exactly midway between the notary's gossip and\nthat of Madame Lepas, as precisely as the middle term of a rule-of-three\nsum stands between the first and third, I have only to relate it in as\nfew words as may be. I shall therefore be brief.\n\n\"The room at la Grande Breteche in which Madame de Merret slept was on\nthe ground floor; a little cupboard in the wall, about four feet deep,\nserved her to hang her dresses in. Three months before the evening of\nwhich I have to relate the events, Madame de Merret had been seriously\nailing, so much so that her husband had left her to herself, and had his\nown bedroom on the first floor. By one of those accidents which it is\nimpossible to foresee, he came in that evening two hours later than\nusual from the club, where he went to read the papers and talk politics\nwith the residents in the neighborhood. His wife supposed him to have\ncome in, to be in bed and asleep. But the invasion of France had been\nthe subject of a very animated discussion; the game of billiards had\nwaxed vehement; he had lost forty francs, an enormous sum at Vendome,\nwhere everybody is thrifty, and where social habits are restrained\nwithin the bounds of a simplicity worthy of all praise, and the\nfoundation perhaps of a form of true happiness which no Parisian would\ncare for.\n\n\"For some time past Monsieur de Merret had been satisfied to ask Rosalie\nwhether his wife was in bed; on the girl's replying always in the\naffirmative, he at once went to his own room, with the good faith that\ncomes of habit and confidence. But this evening, on coming in, he took\nit into his head to go to see Madame de Merret, to tell her of his\nill-luck, and perhaps to find consolation. During dinner he had observed\nthat his wife was very becomingly dressed; he reflected as he came\nhome from the club that his wife was certainly much better, that\nconvalescence had improved her beauty, discovering it, as husbands\ndiscover everything, a little too late. Instead of calling Rosalie,\nwho was in the kitchen at the moment watching the cook and the coachman\nplaying a puzzling hand at cards, Monsieur de Merret made his way to his\nwife's room by the light of his lantern, which he set down at the lowest\nstep of the stairs. His step, easy to recognize, rang under the vaulted\npassage.\n\n\"At the instant when the gentleman turned the key to enter his wife's\nroom, he fancied he heard the door shut of the closet of which I have\nspoken; but when he went in, Madame de Merret was alone, standing in\nfront of the fireplace. The unsuspecting husband fancied that Rosalie\nwas in the cupboard; nevertheless, a doubt, ringing in his ears like a\npeal of bells, put him on his guard; he looked at his wife, and read in\nher eyes an indescribably anxious and haunted expression.\n\n\"'You are very late,' said she.--Her voice, usually so clear and sweet,\nstruck him as being slightly husky.\n\n\"Monsieur de Merret made no reply, for at this moment Rosalie came in.\nThis was like a thunder-clap. He walked up and down the room, going from\none window to another at a regular pace, his arms folded.\n\n\"'Have you had bad news, or are you ill?' his wife asked him timidly,\nwhile Rosalie helped her to undress. He made no reply.\n\n\"'You can go, Rosalie,' said Madame de Merret to her maid; 'I can put in\nmy curl-papers myself.'--She scented disaster at the mere aspect of her\nhusband's face, and wished to be alone with him. As soon as Rosalie\nwas gone, or supposed to be gone, for she lingered a few minutes in the\npassage, Monsieur de Merret came and stood facing his wife, and said\ncoldly, 'Madame, there is some one in your cupboard!' She looked at her\nhusband calmly, and replied quite simply, 'No, monsieur.'\n\n\"This 'No' wrung Monsieur de Merret's heart; he did not believe it; and\nyet his wife had never appeared purer or more saintly than she seemed\nto be at this moment. He rose to go and open the closet door. Madame de\nMerret took his hand, stopped him, looked at him sadly, and said in a\nvoice of strange emotion, 'Remember, if you should find no one there,\neverything must be at an end between you and me.'\n\n\"The extraordinary dignity of his wife's attitude filled him with deep\nesteem for her, and inspired him with one of those resolves which need\nonly a grander stage to become immortal.\n\n\"'No, Josephine,' he said, 'I will not open it. In either event we\nshould be parted for ever. Listen; I know all the purity of your soul, I\nknow you lead a saintly life, and would not commit a deadly sin to save\nyour life.'--At these words Madame de Merret looked at her husband with\na haggard stare.--'See, here is your crucifix,' he went on. 'Swear to\nme before God that there is no one in there; I will believe you--I will\nnever open that door.'\n\n\"Madame de Merret took up the crucifix and said, 'I swear it.'\n\n\"'Louder,' said her husband; 'and repeat: \"I swear before God that there\nis nobody in that closet.\"' She repeated the words without flinching.\n\n\"'That will do,' said Monsieur de Merret coldly. After a moment's\nsilence: 'You have there a fine piece of work which I never saw before,'\nsaid he, examining the crucifix of ebony and silver, very artistically\nwrought.\n\n\"'I found it at Duvivier's; last year when that troop of Spanish\nprisoners came through Vendome, he bought it of a Spanish monk.'\n\n\"'Indeed,' said Monsieur de Merret, hanging the crucifix on its nail;\nand he rang the bell.\n\n\"He had to wait for Rosalie. Monsieur de Merret went forward quickly\nto meet her, led her into the bay of the window that looked on to the\ngarden, and said to her in an undertone:\n\n\"'I know that Gorenflot wants to marry you, that poverty alone prevents\nyour setting up house, and that you told him you would not be his wife\ntill he found means to become a master mason.--Well, go and fetch him;\ntell him to come here with his trowel and tools. Contrive to wake no one\nin his house but himself. His reward will be beyond your wishes. Above\nall, go out without saying a word--or else!' and he frowned.\n\n\"Rosalie was going, and he called her back. 'Here, take my latch-key,'\nsaid he.\n\n\"'Jean!' Monsieur de Merret called in a voice of thunder down the\npassage. Jean, who was both coachman and confidential servant, left his\ncards and came.\n\n\"'Go to bed, all of you,' said his master, beckoning him to come close;\nand the gentleman added in a whisper, 'When they are all asleep--mind,\n_asleep_--you understand?--come down and tell me.'\n\n\"Monsieur de Merret, who had never lost sight of his wife while giving\nhis orders, quietly came back to her at the fireside, and began to tell\nher the details of the game of billiards and the discussion at the club.\nWhen Rosalie returned she found Monsieur and Madame de Merret conversing\namiably.\n\n\"Not long before this Monsieur de Merret had had new ceilings made to\nall the reception-rooms on the ground floor. Plaster is very scarce at\nVendome; the price is enhanced by the cost of carriage; the gentleman\nhad therefore had a considerable quantity delivered to him, knowing\nthat he could always find purchasers for what might be left. It was this\ncircumstance which suggested the plan he carried out.\n\n\"'Gorenflot is here, sir,' said Rosalie in a whisper.\n\n\"'Tell him to come in,' said her master aloud.\n\n\"Madame de Merret turned paler when she saw the mason.\n\n\"'Gorenflot,' said her husband, 'go and fetch some bricks from the\ncoach-house; bring enough to wall up the door of this cupboard; you can\nuse the plaster that is left for cement.' Then, dragging Rosalie and the\nworkman close to him--'Listen, Gorenflot,' said he, in a low voice,\n'you are to sleep here to-night; but to-morrow morning you shall have a\npassport to take you abroad to a place I will tell you of. I will give\nyou six thousand francs for your journey. You must live in that town for\nten years; if you find you do not like it, you may settle in another,\nbut it must be in the same country. Go through Paris and wait there till\nI join you. I will there give you an agreement for six thousand francs\nmore, to be paid to you on your return, provided you have carried out\nthe conditions of the bargain. For that price you are to keep perfect\nsilence as to what you have to do this night. To you, Rosalie, I will\nsecure ten thousand francs, which will not be paid to you till your\nwedding day, and on condition of your marrying Gorenflot; but, to get\nmarried, you must hold your tongue. If not, no wedding gift!'\n\n\"'Rosalie,' said Madame de Merret, 'come and brush my hair.'\n\n\"Her husband quietly walked up and down the room, keeping an eye on the\ndoor, on the mason, and on his wife, but without any insulting display\nof suspicion. Gorenflot could not help making some noise. Madame de\nMerret seized a moment when he was unloading some bricks, and when her\nhusband was at the other end of the room to say to Rosalie: 'My dear\nchild, I will give you a thousand francs a year if only you will tell\nGorenflot to leave a crack at the bottom.' Then she added aloud quite\ncoolly: 'You had better help him.'\n\n\"Monsieur and Madame de Merret were silent all the time while Gorenflot\nwas walling up the door. This silence was intentional on the husband's\npart; he did not wish to give his wife the opportunity of saying\nanything with a double meaning. On Madame de Merret's side it was pride\nor prudence. When the wall was half built up the cunning mason took\nadvantage of his master's back being turned to break one of the two\npanes in the top of the door with a blow of his pick. By this Madame de\nMerret understood that Rosalie had spoken to Gorenflot. They all three\nthen saw the face of a dark, gloomy-looking man, with black hair and\nflaming eyes.\n\n\"Before her husband turned round again the poor woman had nodded to the\nstranger, to whom the signal was meant to convey, 'Hope.'\n\n\"At four o'clock, as the day was dawning, for it was the month of\nSeptember, the work was done. The mason was placed in charge of Jean,\nand Monsieur de Merret slept in his wife's room.\n\n\"Next morning when he got up he said with apparent carelessness, 'Oh,\nby the way, I must go to the Maire for the passport.' He put on his hat,\ntook two or three steps towards the door, paused, and took the crucifix.\nHis wife was trembling with joy.\n\n\"'He will go to Duvivier's,' thought she.\n\n\"As soon as he had left, Madame de Merret rang for Rosalie, and then in\na terrible voice she cried: 'The pick! Bring the pick! and set to work.\nI saw how Gorenflot did it yesterday; we shall have time to make a gap\nand build it up again.'\n\n\"In an instant Rosalie had brought her mistress a sort of cleaver; she,\nwith a vehemence of which no words can give an idea, set to work to\ndemolish the wall. She had already got out a few bricks, when, turning\nto deal a stronger blow than before, she saw behind her Monsieur de\nMerret. She fainted away.\n\n\"'Lay madame on her bed,' said he coldly.\n\n\"Foreseeing what would certainly happen in his absence, he had laid\nthis trap for his wife; he had merely written to the Maire and sent for\nDuvivier. The jeweler arrived just as the disorder in the room had been\nrepaired.\n\n\"'Duvivier,' asked Monsieur de Merret, 'did not you buy some crucifixes\nof the Spaniards who passed through the town?'\n\n\"'No, monsieur.'\n\n\"'Very good; thank you,' said he, flashing a tiger's glare at his wife.\n'Jean,' he added, turning to his confidential valet, 'you can serve my\nmeals here in Madame de Merret's room. She is ill, and I shall not leave\nher till she recovers.'\n\n\"The cruel man remained in his wife's room for twenty days. During\nthe earlier time, when there was some little noise in the closet,\nand Josephine wanted to intercede for the dying man, he said, without\nallowing her to utter a word, 'You swore on the Cross that there was no\none there.'\"\n\n\nAfter this story all the ladies rose from table, and thus the spell\nunder which Bianchon had held them was broken.

After discovering that Fox studied archaeology and had done some digging in the very canyon they now occupy, the men have him cleared through security and offer to make him part of their team. Then Ashe tells him that he will be joining an expedition 10,000 years into the past to look for a spaceship.\nDisguised as Folsom hunters, Fox, Ashe, and Ross Murdock travel into the past to scout out the area around the wreckage of an alien starship, a sphere perhaps 120 feet in diameter. They find the wreck near a lake and then, across a ridge, they find a smaller spaceship intact, its crew of Baldies dead. After receiving the scouts’ report via transtemporal telegraph, Major Kelgarries, the project’s director, and several technicians come into the past and examine the small ship, determining that they can shift it directly into the present.\nFox, Ashe, and Murdock serve as roving sentries in the area around the smaller globeship as technicians build a time transfer cage around it. The ash from a volcanic explosion and a stampede of mammoths drive the three men into the ship with Case Renfry, an electronics technician, on the day the transfer is to be made. An earthquake triggers the transfer, bringing the ship into the present, and then the ship’s preset autopilot, jolted into action, takes the ship into space.\nAfter carrying the men through hyperspace, the ship lands on a planet where faltering robots refuel the ship. Another leap through hyperspace brings the ship to the second planet of an alien solar system. The ship lands in a desert, sits for a couple of days, and then blasts off on a course that takes it to the system’s Earth-like third planet. Upon landing the ship indicates that the voyage has ended by ejecting a small discus from its autopilot.\nRenfry attempts to understand the autopilot and to rewind the course “tape” while the three time agents explore the jungle-draped ruins of a once-great city, in which they’ve landed. After several weeks Renfry believes that he has succeeded and he attempts to launch the ship. The ship runs its course in reverse, pausing on the desert planet and the refueling station, and brings the four men back to Earth, landing on the very spot from which they had blasted off.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK DERELICT ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    _What was the mystery of this great ship from the dark, deep reaches\n    of space? For, within its death-filled chambers--was the avenue of\n    life!_\n\n\nDERELICT\n\nBy Alan E. Nourse\n\nIllustrated by Ed Emsh\n\n\nJohn Sabo, second in command, sat bolt upright in his bunk, blinking\nwide-eyed at the darkness. The alarm was screaming through the Satellite\nStation, its harsh, nerve-jarring clang echoing and re-echoing down the\nmetal corridors, penetrating every nook and crevice and cubicle of the\nlonely outpost, screaming incredibly through the dark sleeping period.\nSabo shook the sleep from his eyes, and then a panic of fear burst into\nhis mind. The alarm! Tumbling out of his bunk in the darkness, he\ncrashed into the far bulkhead, staggering giddily in the impossible\ngravity as he pawed about for his magnaboots, his heart pounding\nfiercely in his ears. The _alarm_! Impossible, after so long, after\nthese long months of bitter waiting-- In the corridor he collided with\nBrownie, looking like a frightened gnome, and he growled profanity as he\nraced down the corridor for the Central Control.\n\nFrightened eyes turned to him as he blinked at the bright lights of the\nroom. The voices rose in a confused, anxious babble, and he shook his\nhead and swore, and ploughed through them toward the screen. \"Kill that\ndamned alarm!\" he roared, blinking as he counted faces. \"Somebody get\nthe Skipper out of his sack, pronto, and stop that clatter! What's the\ntrouble?\"\n\nThe radioman waved feebly at the view screen, shimmering on the great\nside panel. \"We just picked it up--\"\n\nIt was a ship, moving in from beyond Saturn's rings, a huge, gray-black\nblob in the silvery screen, moving in toward the Station with ponderous,\nclumsy grace, growing larger by the second as it sped toward them. Sabo\nfelt the fear spill over in his mind, driving out all thought, and he\nsank into the control chair like a well-trained automaton. His gray eyes\nwere wide, trained for long military years to miss nothing; his fingers\nmoved over the panel with deft skill. \"Get the men to stations,\" he\ngrowled, \"and will somebody kindly get the Skipper down here, if he can\nmanage to take a minute.\"\n\n\"I'm right here.\" The little graying man was at his elbow, staring at\nthe screen with angry red eyes. \"Who told you to shut off the alarm?\"\n\n\"Nobody told me. Everyone was here, and it was getting on my nerves.\"\n\n\"What a shame.\" Captain Loomis' voice was icy. \"I give orders on this\nStation,\" he said smoothly, \"and you'll remember it.\" He scowled at the\ngreat gray ship, looming closer and closer. \"What's its course?\"\n\n\"Going to miss us by several thousand kilos at least. Look at that\nthing! It's _traveling_.\"\n\n\"Contact it! This is what we've been waiting for.\" The captain's voice\nwas hoarse.\n\nSabo spun a dial, and cursed. \"No luck. Can't get through. It's passing\nus--\"\n\n\"Then _grapple_ it, stupid! You want me to wipe your nose, too?\"\n\nSabo's face darkened angrily. With slow precision he set the servo fixes\non the huge gray hulk looming up in the viewer, and then snapped the\nswitches sharply. Two small servos shoved their blunt noses from the\nlanding port of the Station, and slipped silently into space alongside.\nThen, like a pair of trained dogs, they sped on their beams straight out\nfrom the Station toward the approaching ship. The intruder was dark,\nmoving at tremendous velocity past the Station, as though unaware of its\nexistence. The servos moved out, and suddenly diverged and reversed,\ntwisting in long arcs to come alongside the strange ship, finally moving\nin at the same velocity on either side. There was a sharp flash of\ncontact power; then, like a mammoth slow-motion monster, the ship jerked\nin midspace and turned a graceful end-for-end arc as the servo-grapplers\ngripped it like leeches and whined, glowing ruddy with the jolting power\nflowing through them. Sabo watched, hardly breathing, until the great\nship spun and slowed and stopped. Then it reversed direction, and the\nservos led it triumphantly back toward the landing port of the Station.\n\nSabo glanced at the radioman, a frown creasing his forehead. \"Still\nnothing?\"\n\n\"Not a peep.\"\n\nHe stared out at the great ship, feeling a chill of wonder and fear\ncrawl up his spine. \"So this is the mysterious puzzle of Saturn,\" he\nmuttered. \"This is what we've been waiting for.\"\n\nThere was a curious eager light in Captain Loomis' eyes as he looked up.\n\"Oh, no. Not this.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Not this. The ships we've seen before were tiny, flat.\" His little eyes\nturned toward the ship, and back to Sabo's heavy face. \"This is\nsomething else, something quite different.\" A smile curved his lips, and\nhe rubbed his hands together. \"We go out for trout and come back with a\nwhale. This ship's from space, deep space. Not from Saturn. This one's\nfrom the stars.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe strange ship hung at the side of the Satellite Station, silent as a\ntomb, still gently rotating as the Station slowly spun in its orbit\naround Saturn.\n\nIn the captain's cabin the men shifted restlessly, uneasily facing the\neager eyes of their captain. The old man paced the floor of the cabin,\nhis white hair mussed, his face red with excitement. Even his carefully\ncalm face couldn't conceal the eagerness burning in his eyes as he faced\nthe crew. \"Still no contact?\" he asked Sparks.\n\nThe radioman shook his head anxiously. \"Not a sign. I've tried every\nsignal I know at every wave frequency that could possibly reach them.\nI've even tried a dozen frequencies that couldn't possibly reach them,\nand I haven't stirred them up a bit. They just aren't answering.\"\n\nCaptain Loomis swung on the group of men. \"All right, now, I want you to\nget this straight. This is our catch. We don't know what's aboard it,\nand we don't know where it came from, but it's our prize. That means not\na word goes back home about it until we've learned all there is to\nlearn. We're going to get the honors on this one, not some eager Admiral\nback home--\"\n\nThe men stirred uneasily, worried eyes seeking Sabo's face in alarm.\n\"What about the law?\" growled Sabo. \"The law says everything must be\nreported within two hours.\"\n\n\"Then we'll break the law,\" the captain snapped. \"I'm captain of this\nStation, and those are your orders. You don't need to worry about the\nlaw--I'll see that you're protected, but this is too big to fumble. This\nship is from the stars. That means it must have an Interstellar drive.\nYou know what that means. The Government will fall all over itself to\nreward us--\"\n\nSabo scowled, and the worry deepened in the men's faces. It was hard to\nimagine the Government falling all over itself for anybody. They knew\ntoo well how the Government worked. They had heard of the swift trials,\nthe harsh imprisonments that awaited even the petty infringers. The\nMilitary Government had no time to waste on those who stepped out of\nline, they had no mercy to spare. And the men knew that their captain\nwas not in favor in top Government circles. Crack patrol commanders were\nnot shunted into remote, lifeless Satellite Stations if their stand in\nthe Government was high. And deep in their minds, somehow, the men knew\nthey couldn't trust this little, sharp-eyed, white-haired man. The\ncredit for such a discovery as this might go to him, yes--but there\nwould be little left for them.\n\n\"The law--\" Sabo repeated stubbornly.\n\n\"Damn the law! We're stationed out here in this limbo to watch Saturn\nand report any activity we see coming from there. There's nothing in our\norders about anything else. There have been ships from there, they\nthink, but not this ship. The Government has spent billions trying to\nfind an Interstellar, and never gotten to first base.\" The captain\npaused, his eyes narrowing. \"We'll go aboard this ship,\" he said softly.\n\"We'll find out what's aboard it, and where it's from, and we'll take\nits drive. There's been no resistance yet, but it could be dangerous. We\ncan't assume anything. The boarding party will report everything they\nfind to me. One of them will have to be a drive man. That's you,\nBrownie.\"\n\nThe little man with the sharp black eyes looked up eagerly. \"I don't\nknow if I could tell anything--\"\n\n\"You can tell more than anyone else here. Nobody else knows space drive.\nI'll count on you. If you bring back a good report, perhaps we can\ncancel out certain--unfortunate items in your record. But one other\nshould board with you--\" His eyes turned toward John Sabo.\n\n\"Not me. This is your goat.\" The mate's eyes were sullen. \"This is gross\nbreach, and you know it. They'll have you in irons when we get back. I\ndon't want anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"You're under orders, Sabo. You keep forgetting.\"\n\n\"They're illegal orders, sir!\"\n\n\"I'll take responsibility for that.\"\n\nSabo looked the old man straight in the eye. \"You mean you'd sell us\ndown a rat hole to save your skin. That's what you mean.\"\n\nCaptain Loomis' eyes widened incredulously. Then his face darkened, and\nhe stepped very close to the big man. \"You'll watch your tongue, I\nthink,\" he gritted. \"Be careful what you say to me, Sabo. Be very\ncareful. Because if you don't, _you'll_ be in irons, and we'll see just\nhow long you last when you get back home. Now you've got your orders.\nYou'll board the ship with Brownie.\"\n\nThe big man's fists were clenched until the knuckles were white. \"You\ndon't know what's over there!\" he burst out. \"We could be slaughtered.\"\n\nThe captain's smile was unpleasant. \"That would be such a pity,\" he\nmurmured. \"I'd really hate to see it happen--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship hung dark and silent, like a shadowy ghost. No flicker of light\ncould be seen aboard it; no sound nor faintest sign of life came from\nthe tall, dark hull plates. It hung there, huge and imponderable, and\nswung around with the Station in its silent orbit.\n\nThe men huddled about Sabo and Brownie, helping them into their pressure\nsuits, checking their equipment. They had watched the little scanning\nbeetles crawl over the surface of the great ship, examining, probing\nevery nook and crevice, reporting crystals, and metals, and irons, while\nthe boarding party prepared. And still the radioman waited alertly for a\nflicker of life from the solemn giant.\n\nFrightened as they were of their part in the illegal secrecy, the\narrival of the ship had brought a change in the crew, lighting fires of\nexcitement in their eyes. They moved faster, their voices were lighter,\nmore cheerful. Long months on the Station had worn on their nerves--out\nof contact with their homes, on a mission that was secretly jeered as\nutter Governmental folly. Ships _had_ been seen, years before,\ndisappearing into the sullen bright atmospheric crust of Saturn, but\nthere had been no sign of anything since. And out there, on the lonely\nguard Station, nerves had run ragged, always waiting, always watching,\nwearing away even the iron discipline of their military background. They\ngrew bitterly weary of the same faces, the same routine, the constant\nrepetition of inactivity. And through the months they had watched with\nincreasing anxiety the conflict growing between the captain and his\nbitter, sullen-eyed second-in-command, John Sabo.\n\nAnd then the ship had come, incredibly, from the depths of space, and\nthe tensions of loneliness were forgotten in the flurry of activity. The\nlocks whined and opened as the two men moved out of the Station on the\nlittle propulsion sleds, linked to the Station with light silk guy\nropes. Sabo settled himself on the sled, cursing himself for falling so\nfoolishly into the captain's scheme, cursing his tongue for wandering.\nAnd deep within him he felt a new sensation, a vague uneasiness and\ninsecurity that he had not felt in all his years of military life. The\nstrange ship was a variant, an imponderable factor thrown suddenly into\nhis small world of hatred and bitterness, forcing him into unknown\nterritory, throwing his mind into a welter of doubts and fears. He\nglanced uneasily across at Brownie, vaguely wishing that someone else\nwere with him. Brownie was a troublemaker, Brownie talked too much,\nBrownie philosophized in a world that ridiculed philosophy. He'd known\nmen like Brownie before, and he knew that they couldn't be trusted.\n\nThe gray hull gleamed at them as they moved toward it, a monstrous wall\nof polished metal. There were no dents, no surface scars from its\npassage through space. They found the entrance lock without difficulty,\nnear the top of the ship's great hull, and Brownie probed the rim of the\nlock with a dozen instruments, his dark eyes burning eagerly. And then,\nwith a squeal that grated in Sabo's ears, the oval port of the ship\nquivered, and slowly opened.\n\nSilently, the sleds moved into the opening. They were in a small vault,\nquite dark, and the sleds settled slowly onto a metal deck. Sabo eased\nhimself from the seat, tuning up his audios to their highest\nsensitivity, moving over to Brownie. Momentarily they touched helmets,\nand Brownie's excited voice came to him, muted, but breathless. \"No\ntrouble getting it open. It worked on the same principle as ours.\"\n\n\"Better get to work on the inner lock.\"\n\nBrownie shot him a sharp glance. \"But what about--inside? I mean, we\ncan't just walk in on them--\"\n\n\"Why not? We've tried to contact them.\"\n\nReluctantly, the little engineer began probing the inner lock with\ntrembling fingers. Minutes later they were easing themselves through,\nmoving slowly down the dark corridor, waiting with pounding hearts for\na sound, a sign. The corridor joined another, and then still another,\nuntil they reached a great oval door. And then they were inside, in the\nheart of the ship, and their eyes widened as they stared at the thing in\nthe center of the great vaulted chamber.\n\n\"My God!\" Brownie's voice was a hoarse whisper in the stillness. \"Look\nat them, Johnny!\"\n\nSabo moved slowly across the room toward the frail, crushed form lying\nagainst the great, gleaming panel. Thin, almost boneless arms were\npasted against the hard metal; an oval, humanoid skull was crushed like\nan eggshell into the knobs and levers of the control panel. Sudden\nhorror shot through the big man as he looked around. At the far side of\nthe room was another of the things, and still another, mashed, like\nlifeless jelly, into the floors and panels. Gently he peeled a bit of\njelly away from the metal, then turned with a mixture of wonder and\ndisgust. \"All dead,\" he muttered.\n\nBrownie looked up at him, his hands trembling. \"No wonder there was no\nsign.\" He looked about helplessly. \"It's a derelict, Johnny. A wanderer.\nHow could it have happened? How long ago?\"\n\nSabo shook his head, bewildered. \"Then it was just chance that it came\nto us, that we saw it--\"\n\n\"No pilot, no charts. It might have wandered for centuries.\" Brownie\nstared about the room, a frightened look on his face. And then he was\nleaning over the control panel, probing at the array of levers, his\nfingers working eagerly at the wiring. Sabo nodded approvingly. \"We'll\nhave to go over it with a comb,\" he said. \"I'll see what I can find in\nthe rest of the ship. You go ahead on the controls and drive.\" Without\nwaiting for an answer he moved swiftly from the round chamber, out into\nthe corridor again, his stomach almost sick.\n\nIt took them many hours. They moved silently, as if even a slight sound\nmight disturb the sleeping alien forms, smashed against the dark metal\npanels. In another room were the charts, great, beautiful charts,\ntotally unfamiliar, studded with star formations he had never seen,\nnoted with curious, meaningless symbols. As Sabo worked he heard Brownie\nmoving down into the depths of the ship, toward the giant engine rooms.\nAnd then, some silent alarm clicked into place in Sabo's mind,\ntightening his stomach, screaming to be heard. Heart pounding, he dashed\ndown the corridor like a cat, seeing again in his mind the bright, eager\neyes of the engineer. Suddenly the meaning of that eagerness dawned on\nhim. He scampered down a ladder, along a corridor, and down another\nladder, down to the engine room, almost colliding with Brownie as he\ncrossed from one of the engines to a battery of generators on the far\nside of the room.\n\n\"Brownie!\"\n\n\"What's the trouble?\"\n\nSabo trembled, then turned away. \"Nothing,\" he muttered. \"Just a\nthought.\" But he watched as the little man snaked into the labyrinth of\ndynamos and coils and wires, peering eagerly, probing, searching, making\nnotes in the little pad in his hand.\n\n\n\nFinally, hours later, they moved again toward the lock where they had\nleft their sleds. Not a word passed between them. The uneasiness was\nstrong in Sabo's mind now, growing deeper, mingling with fear and a\npremonition of impending evil. A dead ship, a derelict, come to them by\nmerest chance from some unthinkably remote star. He cursed, without\nknowing why, and suddenly he felt he hated Brownie as much as he hated\nthe captain waiting for them in the Station.\n\nBut as he stepped into the Station's lock, a new thought crossed his\nmind, almost dazzling him with its unexpectedness. He looked at the\nengineer's thin face, and his hands were trembling as he opened the\npressure suit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe deliberately took longer than was necessary to give his report to the\ncaptain, dwelling on unimportant details, watching with malicious\namusement the captain's growing annoyance. Captain Loomis' eyes kept\nsliding to Brownie, as though trying to read the information he wanted\nfrom the engineer's face. Sabo rolled up the charts slowly, stowing them\nin a pile on the desk. \"That's the picture, sir. Perhaps a qualified\nastronomer could make something of it; I haven't the knowledge or the\ninstruments. The ship came from outside the system, beyond doubt.\nProbably from a planet with lighter gravity than our own, judging from\nthe frailty of the creatures. Oxygen breathers, from the looks of their\ngas storage. If you ask me, I'd say--\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" the captain breathed impatiently. \"You can write\nit up and hand it to me. It isn't really important where they came from,\nor whether they breathe oxygen or fluorine.\" He turned his eyes to the\nengineer, and lit a cigar with trembling fingers. \"The important thing\nis _how_ they got here. The drive, Brownie. You went over the engines\ncarefully? What did you find?\"\n\nBrownie twitched uneasily, and looked at the floor. \"Oh, yes, I examined\nthem carefully. Wasn't too hard. I examined every piece of drive\nmachinery on the ship, from stem to stern.\"\n\nSabo nodded, slowly, watching the little man with a carefully blank\nface. \"That's right. You gave it a good going over.\"\n\nBrownie licked his lips. \"It's a derelict, like Johnny told you. They\nwere dead. All of them. Probably had been dead for a long time. I\ncouldn't tell, of course. Probably nobody could tell. But they must have\nbeen dead for centuries--\"\n\nThe captain's eyes blinked as the implication sank in. \"Wait a minute,\"\nhe said. \"What do you mean, _centuries_?\"\n\nBrownie stared at his shoes. \"The atomic piles were almost dead,\" he\nmuttered in an apologetic whine. \"The ship wasn't going any place,\ncaptain. It was just wandering. Maybe it's wandered for thousands of\nyears.\" He took a deep breath, and his eyes met the captain's for a\nbrief agonized moment. \"They don't have Interstellar, sir. Just plain,\nsimple, slow atomics. Nothing different. They've been traveling for\ncenturies, and it would have taken them just as long to get back.\"\n\nThe captain's voice was thin, choked. \"Are you trying to tell me that\ntheir drive is no different from our own? That a ship has actually\nwandered into Interstellar space _without a space drive_?\"\n\nBrownie spread his hands helplessly. \"Something must have gone wrong.\nThey must have started off for another planet in their own system, and\nsomething went wrong. They broke into space, and they all died. And the\nship just went on moving. They never intended an Interstellar hop. They\ncouldn't have. They didn't have the drive for it.\"\n\nThe captain sat back numbly, his face pasty gray. The light had faded in\nhis eyes now; he sat as though he'd been struck. \"You--you couldn't be\nwrong? You couldn't have missed anything?\"\n\nBrownie's eyes shifted unhappily, and his voice was very faint. \"No,\nsir.\"\n\nThe captain stared at them for a long moment, like a stricken child.\nSlowly he picked up one of the charts, his mouth working. Then, with a\nbitter roar, he threw it in Sabo's face. \"Get out of here! Take this\ngarbage and get out! And get the men to their stations. We're here to\nwatch Saturn, and by god, we'll watch Saturn!\" He turned away, a hand\nover his eyes, and they heard his choking breath as they left the\ncabin.\n\nSlowly, Brownie walked out into the corridor, started down toward his\ncabin, with Sabo silent at his heels. He looked up once at the mate's\nheavy face, a look of pleading in his dark brown eyes, and then opened\nthe door to his quarters. Like a cat, Sabo was in the room before him,\ndragging him in, slamming the door. He caught the little man by the neck\nwith one savage hand, and shoved him unceremoniously against the door,\nhis voice a vicious whisper. \"_All right, talk! Let's have it now!_\"\n\nBrownie choked, his eyes bulging, his face turning gray in the dim light\nof the cabin. \"Johnny! Let me down! What's the matter? You're choking\nme, Johnny--\"\n\nThe mate's eyes were red, with heavy lines of disgust and bitterness\nrunning from his eyes and the corners of his mouth. \"You stinking little\nliar! _Talk_, damn it! You're not messing with the captain now, you're\nmessing with _me_, and I'll have the truth if I have to cave in your\nskull--\"\n\n\"I told you the truth! I don't know what you mean--\"\n\nSabo's palm smashed into his face, jerking his head about like an apple\non a string. \"That's the wrong answer,\" he grated. \"I warn you, don't\nlie! The captain is an ambitious ass, he couldn't think his way through\na multiplication table. He's a little child. But I'm not quite so dull.\"\nHe threw the little man down in a heap, his eyes blazing. \"You silly\nfool, your story is so full of holes you could drive a tank through it.\nThey just up and died, did they? I'm supposed to believe that? Smashed\nup against the panels the way they were? Only one thing could crush them\nlike that. Any fool could see it. Acceleration. And I don't mean atomic\nacceleration. Something else.\" He glared down at the man quivering on\nthe floor. \"They had Interstellar drive, didn't they, Brownie?\"\n\nBrownie nodded his head, weakly, almost sobbing, trying to pull himself\nerect. \"Don't tell the captain,\" he sobbed. \"Oh, Johnny, for god's sake,\nlisten to me, don't let him know I lied. I was going to tell you anyway,\nJohnny, really I was. I've got a plan, a good plan, can't you see it?\"\nThe gleam of excitement came back into the sharp little eyes. \"They had\nit, all right. Their trip probably took just a few months. They had a\ndrive I've never seen before, non-atomic. I couldn't tell the principle,\nwith the look I had, but I think I could work it.\" He sat up, his whole\nbody trembling. \"Don't give me away, Johnny, listen a minute--\"\n\nSabo sat back against the bunk, staring at the little man. \"You're out\nof your mind,\" he said softly. \"You don't know what you're doing. What\nare you going to do when His Nibs goes over for a look himself? He's\nstupid, but not that stupid.\"\n\nBrownie's voice choked, his words tumbling over each other in his\neagerness. \"He won't get a chance to see it, Johnny. He's got to take\nour word until he sees it, and we can stall him--\"\n\nSabo blinked. \"A day or so--maybe. But what then? Oh, how could you be\nso stupid? He's on the skids, he's out of favor and fighting for his\nlife. That drive is the break that could put him on top. Can't you see\nhe's selfish? He has to be, in this world, to get anything. Anything or\nanyone who blocks him, he'll destroy, if he can. Can't you see that?\nWhen he spots this, your life won't be worth spitting at.\"\n\nBrownie was trembling as he sat down opposite the big man. His voice was\nharsh in the little cubicle, heavy with pain and hopelessness. \"That's\nright,\" he said. \"My life isn't worth a nickle. Neither is yours.\nNeither is anybody's, here or back home. Nobody's life is worth a\nnickle. Something's happened to us in the past hundred years,\nJohnny--something horrible. I've seen it creeping and growing up around\nus all my life. People don't matter any more, it's the Government, what\nthe Government thinks that matters. It's a web, a cancer that grows in\nits own pattern, until it goes so far it can't be stopped. Men like\nLoomis could see the pattern, and adapt to it, throw away all the\nworthwhile things, the love and beauty and peace that we once had in our\nlives. Those men can get somewhere, they can turn this life into a\nclimbing game, waiting their chance to get a little farther toward the\ntop, a little closer to some semblance of security--\"\n\n\"Everybody adapts to it,\" Sabo snapped. \"They have to. You don't see me\nmoving for anyone else, do you? I'm for _me_, and believe me I know it.\nI don't give a hang for you, or Loomis, or anyone else alive--just me. I\nwant to stay alive, that's all. You're a dreamer, Brownie. But until you\npull something like this, you can learn to stop dreaming if you want\nto--\"\n\n\"No, no, you're wrong--oh, you're horribly wrong, Johnny. Some of us\n_can't_ adapt, we haven't got what it takes, or else we have something\nelse in us that won't let us go along. And right there we're beat before\nwe start. There's no place for us now, and there never will be.\" He\nlooked up at the mate's impassive face. \"We're in a life where we don't\nbelong, impounded into a senseless, never-ending series of fights and\nskirmishes and long, lonely waits, feeding this insane urge of the\nGovernment to expand, out to the planets, to the stars, farther and\nfarther, bigger and bigger. We've got to go, seeking newer and greater\nworlds to conquer, with nothing to conquer them with, and nothing to\nconquer them for. There's life somewhere else in our solar system, so it\nmust be sought out and conquered, no matter what or where it is. We live\nin a world of iron and fear, and there was no place for me, and others\nlike me, _until this ship came_--\"\n\nSabo looked at him strangely. \"So I was right. I read it on your face\nwhen we were searching the ship. I knew what you were thinking....\" His\nface darkened angrily. \"You couldn't get away with it, Brownie. Where\ncould you go, what could you expect to find? You're talking death,\nBrownie. Nothing else--\"\n\n\"No, no. Listen, Johnny.\" Brownie leaned closer, his eyes bright and\nintent on the man's heavy face. \"The captain has to take our word for\nit, until he sees the ship. Even then he couldn't tell for sure--I'm\nthe only drive engineer on the Station. We have the charts, we could\nwork with them, try to find out where the ship came from; I already have\nan idea of how the drive is operated. Another look and I could make it\nwork. Think of it, Johnny! What difference does it make where we went,\nor what we found? You're a misfit, too, you know that--this coarseness\nand bitterness is a shell, if you could only see it, a sham. You don't\nreally believe in this world we're in--who cares where, if only we could\ngo, get away? Oh, it's a chance, the wildest, freak chance, but we could\ntake it--\"\n\n\"If only to get away from _him_,\" said Sabo in a muted voice. \"Lord, how\nI hate him. I've seen smallness and ambition before--pettiness and\ntreachery, plenty of it. But that man is our whole world knotted up in\none little ball. I don't think I'd get home without killing him, just to\nstop that voice from talking, just to see fear cross his face one time.\nBut if we took the ship, it would break him for good.\" A new light\nappeared in the big man's eyes. \"He'd be through, Brownie. Washed up.\"\n\n\"And we'd be _free_--\"\n\nSabo's eyes were sharp. \"What about the acceleration? It killed those\nthat came in the ship.\"\n\n\"But they were so frail, so weak. Light brittle bones and soft jelly.\nOur bodies are stronger, we could stand it.\"\n\nSabo sat for a long time, staring at Brownie. His mind was suddenly\nconfused by the scope of the idea, racing in myriad twirling fantasies,\nparading before his eyes the long, bitter, frustrating years, the\nhopelessness of his own life, the dull aching feeling he felt deep in\nhis stomach and bones each time he set back down on Earth, to join the\nteeming throngs of hungry people. He thought of the rows of drab\napartments, the thin faces, the hollow, hunted eyes of the people he had\nseen. He knew that that was why he was a soldier--because soldiers ate\nwell, they had time to sleep, they were never allowed long hours to\nthink, and wonder, and grow dull and empty. But he knew his life had\nbeen barren. The life of a mindless automaton, moving from place to\nplace, never thinking, never daring to think or speak, hoping only to\nwork without pain each day, and sleep without nightmares.\n\nAnd then, he thought of the nights in his childhood, when he had lain\nawake, sweating with fear, as the airships screamed across the dark sky\nabove, bound he never knew where; and then, hearing in the far distance\nthe booming explosion, he had played that horrible little game with\nhimself, seeing how high he could count before he heard the weary,\nplodding footsteps of the people on the road, moving on to another\nplace. He had known, even as a little boy, that the only safe place was\nin those bombers, that the place for survival was in the striking\narmies, and his life had followed the hard-learned pattern, twisting him\ninto the cynical mold of the mercenary soldier, dulling the quick and\nclever mind, drilling into him the ways and responses of order and obey,\nstripping him of his heritage of love and humanity. Others less\nthoughtful had been happier; they had succeeded in forgetting the life\nthey had known before, they had been able to learn easily and well the\nlessons of the repudiation of the rights of men which had crept like a\nblight through the world. But Sabo, too, was a misfit, wrenched into a\nmold he could not fit. He had sensed it vaguely, never really knowing\nwhen or how he had built the shell of toughness and cynicism, but also\nsensing vaguely that it was built, and that in it he could hide,\nsomehow, and laugh at himself, and his leaders, and the whole world\nthrough which he plodded. He had laughed, but there had been long\nnights, in the narrow darkness of spaceship bunks, when his mind pounded\nat the shell, screaming out in nightmare, and he had wondered if he had\nreally lost his mind.\n\nHis gray eyes narrowed as he looked at Brownie, and he felt his heart\npounding in his chest, pounding with a fury that he could no longer\ndeny. \"It would have to be fast,\" he said softly. \"Like lightning,\ntonight, tomorrow--very soon.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know that. But we _can_ do it--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sabo, with a hard, bitter glint in his eyes. \"Maybe we can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe preparation was tense. For the first time in his life, Sabo knew the\nmeaning of real fear, felt the clinging aura of sudden death in every\nglance, every word of the men around him. It seemed incredible that the\ncaptain didn't notice the brief exchanges with the little engineer, or\nhis own sudden appearances and disappearances about the Station. But the\ncaptain sat in his cabin with angry eyes, snapping answers without even\nlooking up. Still, Sabo knew that the seeds of suspicion lay planted in\nhis mind, ready to burst forth with awful violence at any slight\nprovocation. As he worked, the escape assumed greater and greater\nproportions in Sabo's mind; he knew with increasing urgency and daring\nthat nothing must stop him. The ship was there, the only bridge away\nfrom a life he could no longer endure, and his determination blinded him\nto caution.\n\nPrimarily, he pondered over the charts, while Brownie, growing hourly\nmore nervous, poured his heart into a study of his notes and sketches. A\nsecond look at the engines was essential; the excuse he concocted for\nreturning to the ship was recklessly slender, and Sabo spent a grueling\nfive minutes dissuading the captain from accompanying him. But the\ncaptain's eyes were dull, and he walked his cabin, sunk in a gloomy,\nremorseful trance.\n\nThe hours passed, and the men saw, in despair, that more precious,\ndangerous hours would be necessary before the flight could be attempted.\nAnd then, abruptly, Sabo got the call to the captain's cabin. He found\nthe old man at his desk, regarding him with cold eyes, and his heart\nsank. The captain motioned him to a seat, and then sat back, lighting a\ncigar with painful slowness. \"I want you to tell me,\" he said in a\nlifeless voice, \"exactly what Brownie thinks he's doing.\"\n\nSabo went cold. Carefully he kept his eyes on the captain's face. \"I\nguess he's nervous,\" he said. \"He doesn't belong on a Satellite Station.\nHe belongs at home. The place gets on his nerves.\"\n\n\"I didn't like his report.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Sabo.\n\nThe captain's eyes narrowed. \"It was hard to believe. Ships don't just\nhappen out of space. They don't wander out interstellar by accident,\neither.\" An unpleasant smile curled his lips. \"I'm not telling you\nanything new. I wouldn't want to accuse Brownie of lying, of course--or\nyou either. But we'll know soon. A patrol craft will be here from the\nTriton supply base in an hour. I signaled as soon as I had your\nreports.\" The smile broadened maliciously. \"The patrol craft will have\nexperts aboard. Space drive experts. They'll review your report.\"\n\n\"An hour--\"\n\nThe captain smiled. \"That's what I said. In that hour, you could tell me\nthe truth. I'm not a drive man, I'm an administrator, and organizer and\ndirector. You're the technicians. The truth now could save you much\nunhappiness--in the future.\"\n\nSabo stood up heavily. \"You've got your information,\" he said with a\nbitter laugh. \"The patrol craft will confirm it.\"\n\nThe captain's face went a shade grayer. \"All right,\" he said. \"Go ahead,\nlaugh. I told you, anyway.\"\n\nSabo didn't realize how his hands were trembling until he reached the\nend of the corridor. In despair he saw the plan crumbling beneath his\nfeet, and with the despair came the cold undercurrent of fear. The\npatrol would discover them, disclose the hoax. There was no choice\nleft--ready or not, they'd _have_ to leave.\n\nQuickly he turned in to the central control room where Brownie was\nworking. He sat down, repeating the captain's news in a soft voice.\n\n\"An _hour_! But how can we--\"\n\n\"We've _got_ to. We can't quit now, we're dead if we do.\"\n\nBrownie's eyes were wide with fear. \"But can't we stall them, somehow?\nMaybe if we turned on the captain--\"\n\n\"The crew would back him. They wouldn't dare go along with us. We've got\nto run, nothing else.\" He took a deep breath. \"Can you control the\ndrive?\"\n\nBrownie stared at his hands. \"I--I think so. I can only try.\"\n\n\"You've got to. It's now or never. Get down to the lock, and I'll get\nthe charts. Get the sleds ready.\"\n\nHe scooped the charts from his bunk, folded them carefully and bound\nthem swiftly with cord. Then he ran silently down the corridor to the\nlanding port lock. Brownie was already there, in the darkness, closing\nthe last clamps on his pressure suit. Sabo handed him the charts, and\nbegan the laborious task of climbing into his own suit, panting in the\ndarkness.\n\nAnd then the alarm was clanging in his ear, and the lock was flooded\nwith brilliant light. Sabo stopped short, a cry on his lips, staring at\nthe entrance to the control room.\n\nThe captain was grinning, a nasty, evil grin, his eyes hard and\nhumorless as he stood there flanked by three crewmen. His hand gripped\nan ugly power gun tightly. He just stood there, grinning, and his voice\nwas like fire in Sabo's ears. \"Too bad,\" he said softly. \"You almost\nmade it, too. Trouble is, two can't keep a secret. Shame, Johnny, a\nsmart fellow like you. I might have expected as much from Brownie, but I\nthought you had more sense--\"\n\nSomething snapped in Sabo's mind, then. With a roar, he lunged at the\ncaptain's feet, screaming his bitterness and rage and frustration,\ncatching the old man's calves with his powerful shoulders. The captain\ntoppled, and Sabo was fighting for the power gun, straining with all his\nmight to twist the gun from the thin hand, and he heard his voice\nshouting, \"Run! _Go, Brownie, make it go!_\"\n\nThe lock was open, and he saw Brownie's sled nose out into the\nblackness. The captain choked, his face purple. \"Get him! Don't let him\nget away!\"\n\nThe lock clanged, and the screens showed the tiny fragile sled jet out\nfrom the side of the Station, the small huddled figure clinging to it,\nheading straight for the open port of the gray ship. \"Stop him! The\nguns, you fools, the guns!\"\n\nThe alarm still clanged, and the control room was a flurry of activity.\nThree men snapped down behind the tracer-guns, firing without aiming, in\na frenzied attempt to catch the fleeing sled. The sled began\nzig-zagging, twisting wildly as the shells popped on either side of it.\nThe captain twisted away from Sabo's grip with a roar, and threw one of\nthe crewmen to the deck, wrenching the gun controls from his hands. \"Get\nthe big ones on the ship! Blast it! If it gets away you'll all pay.\"\n\nSuddenly the sled popped into the ship's port, and the hatch slowly\nclosed behind it. Raving, the captain turned the gun on the sleek,\npolished hull plates, pressed the firing levels on the war-head servos.\nThree of them shot out from the Satellite, like deadly bugs, careening\nthrough the intervening space, until one of them struck the side of the\ngray ship, and exploded in purple fury against the impervious hull. And\nthe others nosed into the flame, and passed on through, striking\nnothing.\n\nLike the blinking of a light, the alien ship had throbbed, and jerked,\nand was gone.\n\nWith a roar the captain brought his fist down on the hard plastic and\nmetal of the control panel, kicked at the sheet of knobs and levers with\na heavy foot, his face purple with rage. His whole body shook as he\nturned on Sabo, his eyes wild. \"You let him get away! It was your fault,\nyours! But _you_ won't get away! I've got you, and you'll pay, do you\nhear that?\" He pulled himself up until his face was bare inches from\nSabo's, his teeth bared in a frenzy of hatred. \"Now we'll see who'll\nlaugh, my friend. You'll laugh in the death chamber, if you can still\nlaugh by then!\" He turned to the men around him. \"Take him,\" he snarled.\n\"Lock him in his quarters, and guard him well. And while you're doing\nit, take a good look at him. See how he laughs now.\"\n\nThey marched him down to his cabin, stunned, still wondering what had\nhappened. Something had gone in his mind in that second, something that\ntold him that the choice had to be made, instantly. Because he knew,\nwith dull wonder, that in that instant when the lights went on he could\nhave stopped Brownie, could have saved himself. He could have taken for\nhimself a piece of the glory and promotion due to the discoverers of an\nInterstellar drive. But he had also known, somehow, in that short\ninstant, that the only hope in the world lay in that one nervous,\nfrightened man, and the ship which could take him away.\n\nAnd the ship was gone. That meant the captain was through. He'd had his\nchance, the ship's coming had given him his chance, and he had muffed\nit. Now he, too, would pay. The Government would not be pleased that\nsuch a ship had leaked through his fingers. Captain Loomis was through.\n\nAnd him? Somehow, it didn't seem to matter any more. He had made a stab\nat it, he had tried. He just hadn't had the luck. But he knew there was\nmore to that. Something in his mind was singing, some deep feeling of\nhappiness and hope had crept into his mind, and he couldn't worry about\nhimself any more. There was nothing more for him; they had him cold. But\ndeep in his mind he felt a curious satisfaction, transcending any fear\nand bitterness. Deep in his heart, he knew that _one_ man had escaped.\n\nAnd then he sat back and laughed.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _If: Worlds of Science Fiction_ May\n    1953.

Ermyntrude, now dressed very plainly gets the job as her lady's maid. Captain Duval, a messenger from the \"Inca of Perusalem\" appears with news that Inca wants one of his sons to marry the Princess. Ermyntrude realises that the messenger is in fact the Inca in disguise. She offers to return the trick, by pretending to be the Princess to find out what his intentions are. The Princess, who is very timid, agrees to let Ermyntrude take charge. Ermyntrude receives the \"captain\" with an air of great superiority. She is given a gift of a jewel, designed by the Inca, but she is horrified by its size. The Inca is impressed by the \"Princess\"'s grand manner and reveals his true identity. However, he says that he recognises Ermyntrude. He knows she is the Archdeacon's daughter, not the Princess. But she is so convincing as a princess that now he wishes to marry her himself. Unfortunately he already has a wife, so he suggests they should to convert to Islam so he can legally have another one. Ermyntrude says the Inca is far too poor for her, since his country is going bankrupt because of its foolish war. The Inca says that the war will result in his overthrow and the creation of a republic, but this will not be a problem as he will be elected as \"super-president\" of the republic. He then says how surprised he is by the popularity of the war in his homeland. He used to rely for popularity on his contributions to art, literature and science, but he was ignored. Now the mass killing in the war leads to cheering crowds. Despite being turned down for marriage, the Inca offers to take Ermyntrude on a drive round the town. She accepts, but emphasises that she will \"refuse any incorrect proposals\" he makes to her.", "normalized_text": "GUTENBERG EBOOK THE INCA OF PERUSALEM ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Eve Sobol\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE INCA OF PERUSALEM: AN ALMOST HISTORICAL COMEDIETTA\n\nBy George Bernard Shaw\n\n\n\nI must remind the reader that this playlet was written when its\nprincipal character, far from being a fallen foe and virtually a\nprisoner in our victorious hands, was still the Caesar whose legions\nwe were resisting with our hearts in our mouths. Many were so horribly\nafraid of him that they could not forgive me for not being afraid of\nhim: I seemed to be trifling heartlessly with a deadly peril. I knew\nbetter; and I have represented Caesar as knowing better himself. But\nit was one of the quaintnesses of popular feeling during the war that\nanyone who breathed the slightest doubt of the absolute perfection of\nGerman organization, the Machiavellian depth of German diplomacy, the\nomniscience of German science, the equipment of every German with a\ncomplete philosophy of history, and the consequent hopelessness\nof overcoming so magnificently accomplished an enemy except by the\nsacrifice of every recreative activity to incessant and vehement war\nwork, including a heartbreaking mass of fussing and cadging and bluffing\nthat did nothing but waste our energies and tire our resolution, was\ncalled a pro-German.\n\nNow that this is all over, and the upshot of the fighting has shown that\nwe could quite well have afforded to laugh at the doomed Inca, I am in\nanother difficulty. I may be supposed to be hitting Caesar when he is\ndown. That is why I preface the play with this reminder that when it\nwas written he was not down. To make quite sure, I have gone through the\nproof sheets very carefully, and deleted everything that could possibly\nbe mistaken for a foul blow. I have of course maintained the ancient\nprivilege of comedy to chasten Caesar's foibles by laughing at them,\nwhilst introducing enough obvious and outrageous fiction to relieve both\nmyself and my model from the obligations and responsibilities of sober\nhistory and biography. But I should certainly put the play in the fire\ninstead of publishing it if it contained a word against our defeated\nenemy that I would not have written in 1913.\n\nThe Inca of Perusalem was performed for the first time in England by\nthe Pioneer Players at the Criterion Theatre, London, on 16th December,\n1917, with Gertrude Kingston as Ermyntrude, Helen Morris as the\nPrincess, Nigel Playfair as the waiter, Alfred Drayton as the hotel\nmanager, C. Wordley Hulse as the Archdeacon, and Randle Ayrton as the\nInca.\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nThe tableau curtains are closed. An English archdeacon comes through\nthem in a condition of extreme irritation. He speaks through the\ncurtains to someone behind them.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Once for all, Ermyntrude, I cannot afford to maintain\nyou in your present extravagance. [He goes to a flight of steps\nleading to the stalls and sits down disconsolately on the top step. A\nfashionably dressed lady comes through the curtains and contemplates him\nwith patient obstinacy. He continues, grumbling.] An English clergyman's\ndaughter should be able to live quite respectably and comfortably on an\nallowance of Â£150 a year, wrung with great difficulty from the domestic\nbudget.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You are not a common clergyman: you are an archdeacon.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON [angrily]. That does not affect my emoluments to the\nextent of enabling me to support a daughter whose extravagance would\ndisgrace a royal personage. [Scrambling to his feet and scolding at\nher.] What do you mean by it, Miss?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh really, father! Miss! Is that the way to talk to a widow?\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Is that the way to talk to a father? Your marriage was\na most disastrous imprudence. It gave you habits that are absolutely\nbeyond your means--I mean beyond my means: you have no means. Why did\nyou not marry Matthews: the best curate I ever had?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I wanted to; and you wouldn't let me. You insisted on my\nmarrying Roosenhonkers-Pipstein.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. I had to do the best for you, my child.\nRoosenhonkers-Pipstein was a millionaire.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. How did you know he was a millionaire?\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. He came from America. Of course he was a millionaire.\nBesides, he proved to my solicitors that he had fifteen million dollars\nwhen you married him.\n\nERYNTRUDE. His solicitors proved to me that he had sixteen millions when\nhe died. He was a millionaire to the last.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. O Mammon, Mammon! I am punished now for bowing the knee\nto him. Is there nothing left of your settlement? Fifty thousand dollars\na year it secured to you, as we all thought. Only half the securities\ncould be called speculative. The other half were gilt-edged. What has\nbecome of it all?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The speculative ones were not paid up; and the gilt-edged\nones just paid the calls on them until the whole show burst up.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Ermyntrude: what expressions!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh bother! If you had lost ten thousand a year what\nexpressions would you use, do you think? The long and the short of it is\nthat I can't live in the squalid way you are accustomed to.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Squalid!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I have formed habits of comfort.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Comfort!!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well, elegance if you like. Luxury, if you insist. Call it\nwhat you please. A house that costs less than a hundred thousand dollars\na year to run is intolerable to me.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Then, my dear, you had better become lady's maid to a\nprincess until you can find another millionaire to marry you.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. That's an idea. I will. [She vanishes through the curtains.]\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. What! Come back. Come back this instant. [The lights are\nlowered.] Oh, very well: I have nothing more to say. [He descends the\nsteps into the auditorium and makes for the door, grumbling all the\ntime.] Insane, senseless extravagance! [Barking.] Worthlessness!!\n[Muttering.] I will not bear it any longer. Dresses, hats, furs,\ngloves, motor rides: one bill after another: money going like water. No\nrestraint, no self-control, no decency. [Shrieking.] I say, no decency!\n[Muttering again.] Nice state of things we are coming to! A pretty\nworld! But I simply will not bear it. She can do as she likes. I wash\nmy hands of her: I am not going to die in the workhouse for any\ngood-for-nothing, undutiful, spendthrift daughter; and the sooner that\nis understood by everybody the better for all par---- [He is by this\ntime out of hearing in the corridor.]\n\n\n\n\nTHE PLAY\n\nA hotel sitting room. A table in the centre. On it a telephone. Two\nchairs at it, opposite one another. Behind it, the door. The fireplace\nhas a mirror in the mantelpiece.\n\nA spinster Princess, hatted and gloved, is ushered in by the hotel\nmanager, spruce and artifically bland by professional habit, but\ntreating his customer with a condescending affability which sails very\nclose to the east wind of insolence.\n\nTHE MANAGER. I am sorry I am unable to accommodate Your Highness on the\nfirst floor.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [very shy and nervous.] Oh, please don't mention it. This\nis quite nice. Very nice. Thank you very much.\n\nTHE MANAGER. We could prepare a room in the annexe--\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh no. This will do very well.\n\nShe takes of her gloves and hat: puts them on the table; and sits down.\n\nTHE MANAGER. The rooms are quite as good up here. There is less noise;\nand there is the lift. If Your Highness desires anything, there is the\ntelephone--\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, thank you, I don't want anything. The telephone is so\ndifficult: I am not accustomed to it.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Can I take any order? Some tea?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, thank you. Yes: I should like some tea, if I might--if\nit would not be too much trouble.\n\nHe goes out. The telephone rings. The Princess starts out of her chair,\nterrified, and recoils as far as possible from the instrument.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh dear! [It rings again. She looks scared. It rings\nagain. She approaches it timidly. It rings again. She retreats hastily.\nIt rings repeatedly. She runs to it in desperation and puts the receiver\nto her ear.] Who is there? What do I do? I am not used to the telephone:\nI don't know how--What! Oh, I can hear you speaking quite distinctly.\n[She sits down, delighted, and settles herself for a conversation.] How\nwonderful! What! A lady? Oh! a person. Oh, yes: I know. Yes, please,\nsend her up. Have my servants finished their lunch yet? Oh no: please\ndon't disturb them: I'd rather not. It doesn't matter. Thank you. What?\nOh yes, it's quite easy. I had no idea--am I to hang it up just as it\nwas? Thank you. [She hangs it up.]\n\nErmyntrude enters, presenting a plain and staid appearance in a long\nstraight waterproof with a hood over her head gear. She comes to the end\nof the table opposite to that at which the Princess is seated.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Excuse me. I have been talking through the telephone: and\nI heard quite well, though I have never ventured before. Won't you sit\ndown?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. No, thank you, Your Highness. I am only a lady's maid. I\nunderstood you wanted one.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh no: you mustn't think I want one. It's so unpatriotic\nto want anything now, on account of the war, you know. I sent my\nmaid away as a public duty; and now she has married a soldier and is\nexpecting a war baby. But I don't know how to do without her. I've tried\nmy very best; but somehow it doesn't answer: everybody cheats me; and\nin the end it isn't any saving. So I've made up my mind to sell my piano\nand have a maid. That will be a real saving, because I really don't care\na bit for music, though of course one has to pretend to. Don't you think\nso?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Certainly I do, Your Highness. Nothing could be more\ncorrect. Saving and self-denial both at once; and an act of kindness to\nme, as I am out of place.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. I'm so glad you see it in that way. Er--you won't mind my\nasking, will you?--how did you lose your place?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The war, Your Highness, the war.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh yes, of course. But how--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [taking out her handkerchief and showing signs of grief]. My\npoor mistress--\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh please say no more. Don't think about it. So tactless\nof me to mention it.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [mastering her emotion and smiling through her tears]. Your\nHighness is too good.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Do you think you could be happy with me? I attach such\nimportance to that.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [gushing]. Oh, I know--I shall.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. You must not expect too much. There is my uncle. He is\nvery severe and hasty; and he is my guardian. I once had a maid I liked\nvery much; but he sent her away the very first time.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The first time of what, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, something she did. I am sure she had never done it\nbefore; and I know she would never have done it again, she was so truly\ncontrite and nice about it.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. About what, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Well, she wore my jewels and one of my dresses at a rather\nimproper ball with her young man; and my uncle saw her.\n\nERYMNTRUDE. Then he was at the ball too, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS [struck by the inference]. I suppose he must have been. I\nwonder! You know, it's very sharp of you to find that out. I hope you\nare not too sharp.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. A lady's maid has to be, Your Highness. [She produces some\nletters.] Your Highness wishes to see my testimonials, no doubt. I have\none from an Archdeacon. [She proffers the letters.]\n\nTHE PRINCESS [taking them]. Do archdeacons have maids? How curious!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. No, Your Highness. They have daughters. I have first-rate\ntestimonials from the Archdeacon and from his daughter.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [reading them]. The daughter says you are in every respect\na treasure. The Archdeacon says he would have kept you if he could\npossibly have afforded it. Most satisfactory, I'm sure.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. May I regard myself as engaged then, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS [alarmed]. Oh, I'm sure I don't know. If you like, of\ncourse; but do you think I ought to?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Naturally I think Your Highness ought to, most decidedly.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh well, if you think that, I daresay you're quite right.\nYou'll excuse my mentioning it, I hope; but what wages--er--?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The same as the maid who went to the ball. Your Highness\nneed not make any change.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. M'yes. Of course she began with less. But she had such a\nnumber of relatives to keep! It was quite heartbreaking: I had to raise\nher wages again and again.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I shall be quite content with what she began on; and I have\nno relatives dependent on me. And I am willing to wear my own dresses at\nballs.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. I am sure nothing could be fairer than that. My uncle\ncan't object to that, can he?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. If he does, Your Highness, ask him to speak to me about\nit. I shall regard it as part of my duties to speak to your uncle about\nmatters of business.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Would you? You must be frightfully courageous.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. May I regard myself as engaged, Your Highness? I should like\nto set about my duties immediately.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh yes, I think so. Oh certainly. I--\n\nA waiter comes in with the tea. He places the tray on the table.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, thank you.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [raising the cover from the tea cake and looking at it]. How\nlong has that been standing at the top of the stairs?\n\nTHE PRINCESS [terrified]. Oh please! It doesn't matter.\n\nTHE WAITER. It has not been waiting. Straight from the kitchen, madam,\nbelieve me.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Send the manager here.\n\nTHE WAITER. The manager! What do you want with the manager?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. He will tell you when I have done with him. How dare you\ntreat Her Highness in this disgraceful manner? What sort of pothouse is\nthis? Where did you learn to speak to persons of quality? Take away your\ncold tea and cold cake instantly. Give them to the chambermaid you were\nflirting with whilst Her Highness was waiting. Order some fresh tea\nat once; and do not presume to bring it yourself: have it brought by a\ncivil waiter who is accustomed to wait on ladies, and not, like you, on\ncommercial travellers.\n\nTHE WAITER. Alas, madam, I am not accustomed to wait on anybody. Two\nyears ago I was an eminent medical man, my waiting-room was crowded with\nthe flower of the aristocracy and the higher bourgeoisie from nine to\nsix every day. But the war came; and my patients were ordered to give\nup their luxuries. They gave up their doctors, but kept their week-end\nhotels, closing every career to me except the career of a waiter.\n[He puts his fingers on the teapot to test its temperature, and\nautomatically takes out his watch with the other hand as if to count the\nteapot's pulse.] You are right: the tea is cold: it was made by the wife\nof a once fashionable architect. The cake is only half toasted: what can\nyou expect from a ruined west-end tailor whose attempt to establish a\nsecond-hand business failed last Tuesday week? Have you the heart to\ncomplain to the manager? Have we not suffered enough? Are our miseries\nnev---- [the manager enters]. Oh Lord! here he is. [The waiter withdraws\nabjectly, taking the tea tray with him.]\n\nTHE MANAGER. Pardon, Your Highness; but I have received an urgent\ninquiry for rooms from an English family of importance; and I venture\nto ask you to let me know how long you intend to honor us with your\npresence.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [rising anxiously]. Oh! am I in the way?\n\nERMYNTRUDE [sternly]. Sit down, madam. [The Princess sits down\nforlornly. Ermyntrude turns imperiously to the Manager.] Her Highness\nwill require this room for twenty minutes.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Twenty minutes!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Yes: it will take fully that time to find a proper apartment\nin a respectable hotel.\n\nTHE MANAGER. I do not understand.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You understand perfectly. How dare you offer Her Highness a\nroom on the second floor?\n\nTHE MANAGER. But I have explained. The first floor is occupied. At\nleast--\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well? at least?\n\nTHE MANAGER. It is occupied.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Don't you dare tell Her Highness a falsehood. It is not\noccupied. You are saving it up for the arrival of the five-fifteen\nexpress, from which you hope to pick up some fat armaments contractor\nwho will drink all the bad champagne in your cellar at 5 francs a\nbottle, and pay twice over for everything because he is in the same\nhotel with Her Highness, and can boast of having turned her out of the\nbest rooms.\n\nTHE MANAGER. But Her Highness was so gracious. I did not know that Her\nHighness was at all particular.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. And you take advantage of Her Highness's graciousness. You\nimpose on her with your stories. You give her a room not fit for a dog.\nYou send cold tea to her by a decayed professional person disguised as a\nwaiter. But don't think you can trifle with me. I am a lady's maid; and\nI know the ladies' maids and valets of all the aristocracies of Europe\nand all the millionaires of America. When I expose your hotel as the\nsecond-rate little hole it is, not a soul above the rank of a curate\nwith a large family will be seen entering it. I shake its dust off my\nfeet. Order the luggage to be taken down at once.\n\nTHE MANAGER [appealing to the Princess]. Can Your Highness believe this\nof me? Have I had the misfortune to offend Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh no. I am quite satisfied. Please--\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Is Your Highness dissatisfied with me?\n\nTHE PRINCESS [intimidated]. Oh no: please don't think that. I only\nmeant--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [to the manager]. You hear. Perhaps you think Her Highness\nis going to do the work of teaching you your place herself, instead of\nleaving it to her maid.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Oh please, mademoiselle. Believe me: our only wish is to\nmake you perfectly comfortable. But in consequence of the war, all royal\npersonages now practise a rigid economy, and desire us to treat them\nlike their poorest subjects.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh yes. You are quite right--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [interrupting]. There! Her Highness forgives you; but don't\ndo it again. Now go downstairs, my good man, and get that suite on the\nfirst floor ready for us. And send some proper tea. And turn on the\nheating apparatus until the temperature in the rooms is comfortably\nwarm. And have hot water put in all the bedrooms--\n\nTHE MANAGER. There are basins with hot and cold taps.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [scornfully]. Yes: there WOULD be. Suppose we must put up\nwith that: sinks in our rooms, and pipes that rattle and bang and guggle\nall over the house whenever anyone washes his hands. I know.\n\nTHE MANAGER [gallant]. You are hard to please, mademoiselle.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. No harder than other people. But when I'm not pleased I'm\nnot too ladylike to say so. That's all the difference. There is nothing\nmore, thank you.\n\nThe Manager shrugs his shoulders resignedly; makes a deep bow to the\nPrincess; goes to the door; wafts a kiss surreptitiously to Ermyntrude;\nand goes out.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. It's wonderful! How have you the courage?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. In Your Highness's service I know no fear. Your Highness can\nleave all unpleasant people to me.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. How I wish I could! The most dreadful thing of all I have\nto go through myself.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Dare I ask what it is, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. I'm going to be married. I'm to be met here and married to\na man I never saw. A boy! A boy who never saw me! One of the sons of the\nInca of Perusalem.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Indeed? Which son?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. I don't know. They haven't settled which. It's a dreadful\nthing to be a princess: they just marry you to anyone they like. The\nInca is to come and look at me, and pick out whichever of his sons he\nthinks will suit. And then I shall be an alien enemy everywhere except\nin Perusalem, because the Inca has made war on everybody. And I shall\nhave to pretend that everybody has made war on him. It's too bad.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Still, a husband is a husband. I wish I had one.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, how can you say that! I'm afraid you're not a nice\nwoman.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Your Highness is provided for. I'm not.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Even if you could bear to let a man touch you, you\nshouldn't say so.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I shall not say so again, Your Highness, except perhaps to\nthe man.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. It's too dreadful to think of. I wonder you can be so\ncoarse. I really don't think you'll suit. I feel sure now that you know\nmore about men than you should.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I am a widow, Your Highness.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [overwhelmed]. Oh, I BEG your pardon. Of course I ought to\nhave known you would not have spoken like that if you were not married.\nThat makes it all right, doesn't it? I'm so sorry.\n\nThe Manager returns, white, scared, hardly able to speak.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Your Highness, an officer asks to see you on behalf of the\nInca of Perusalem.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [rising distractedly]. Oh, I can't, really. Oh, what shall\nI do?\n\nTHE MANAGER. On important business, he says, Your Highness. Captain\nDuval.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Duval! Nonsense! The usual thing. It is the Inca himself,\nincognito.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, send him away. Oh, I'm so afraid of the Inca. I'm not\nproperly dressed to receive him; and he is so particular: he would order\nme to stay in my room for a week. Tell him to call tomorrow: say I'm ill\nin bed. I can't: I won't: I daren't: you must get rid of him somehow.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Leave him to me, Your Highness.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. You'd never dare!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I am an Englishwoman, Your Highness, and perfectly capable\nof tackling ten Incas if necessary. I will arrange the matter. [To the\nManager.] Show Her Highness to her bedroom; and then show Captain Duval\nin here.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, thank you so much. [She goes to the door. Ermyntrude,\nnoticing that she has left her hat and gloves on the table, runs after\nher with them.] Oh, THANK you. And oh, please, if I must have one of his\nsons, I should like a fair one that doesn't shave, with soft hair and a\nbeard. I couldn't bear being kissed by a bristly person. [She runs out,\nthe Manager bowing as she passes. He follows her.]\n\nErmyntrude whips off her waterproof; hides it; and gets herself swiftly\ninto perfect trim at the mirror, before the Manager, with a large jewel\ncase in his hand, returns, ushering in the Inca.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Captain Duval.\n\nThe Inca, in military uniform, advances with a marked and imposing stage\nwalk; stops; orders the trembling Manager by a gesture to place the\njewel case on the table; dismisses him with a frown; touches his helmet\ngraciously to Ermyntrude; and takes off his cloak.\n\nTHE INCA. I beg you, madam, to be quite at your ease, and to speak to me\nwithout ceremony.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [moving haughtily and carelessly to the table]. I hadn't the\nslightest intention of treating you with ceremony. [She sits down: a\nliberty which gives him a perceptible shock.] I am quite at a loss to\nimagine why I should treat a perfect stranger named Duval: a captain!\nalmost a subaltern! with the smallest ceremony.\n\nTHE INCA. That is true. I had for the moment forgotten my position.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. It doesn't matter. You may sit down.\n\nTHE INCA [frowning.] What!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I said, you...may...sit...down.\n\nTHE INCA. Oh. [His moustache droops. He sits down.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. What is your business?\n\nTHE INCA. I come on behalf of the Inca of Perusalem.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The Allerhochst?\n\nTHE INCA. Precisely.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I wonder does he feel ridiculous when people call him the\nAllerhochst.\n\nTHE INCA [surprised]. Why should he? He IS the Allerhochst.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Is he nice looking?\n\nTHE INCA. I--er. Er--I. I--er. I am not a good judge.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. They say he takes himself very seriously.\n\nTHE INCA. Why should he not, madam? Providence has entrusted to his\nfamily the care of a mighty empire. He is in a position of half divine,\nhalf paternal, responsibility towards sixty millions of people, whose\nduty it is to die for him at the word of command. To take himself\notherwise than seriously would be blasphemous. It is a punishable\noffence--severely punishable--in Perusalem. It is called\nIncadisparagement.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. How cheerful! Can he laugh?\n\nTHE INCA. Certainly, madam. [He laughs, harshly and mirthlessly.] Ha ha!\nHa ha ha!\n\nERMYNTRUDE [frigidly]. I asked could the Inca laugh. I did not ask could\nyou laugh.\n\nTHE INCA. That is true, madam. [Chuckling.] Devilish amusing, that!\n[He laughs, genially and sincerely, and becomes a much more agreeable\nperson.] Pardon me: I am now laughing because I cannot help it. I am\namused. The other was merely an imitation: a failure, I admit.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You intimated that you had some business?\n\nTHE INCA [producing a very large jewel case, and relapsing into\nsolemnity.] I am instructed by the Allerhochst to take a careful note\nof your features and figure, and, if I consider them satisfactory, to\npresent you with this trifling token of His Imperial Majesty's regard.\nI do consider them satisfactory. Allow me [he opens the jewel case and\npresents it.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [staring at the contents]. What awful taste he must have! I\ncan't wear that.\n\nTHE INCA [reddening]. Take care, madam! This brooch was designed by the\nInca himself. Allow me to explain the design. In the centre, the shield\nof Arminius. The ten surrounding medallions represent the ten castles\nof His Majesty. The rim is a piece of the telephone cable laid by His\nMajesty across the Shipskeel canal. The pin is a model in miniature of\nthe sword of Henry the Birdcatcher.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Miniature! It must be bigger than the original. My good man,\nyou don't expect me to wear this round my neck: it's as big as a turtle.\n[He shuts the case with an angry snap.] How much did it cost?\n\nTHE INCA. For materials and manufacture alone, half a million Perusalem\ndollars, madam. The Inca's design constitutes it a work of art. As such,\nit is now worth probably ten million dollars.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Give it to me [she snatches it]. I'll pawn it and buy\nsomething nice with the money.\n\nTHE INCA. Impossible, madam. A design by the Inca must not be exhibited\nfor sale in the shop window of a pawnbroker. [He flings himself into his\nchair, fuming.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. So much the better. The Inca will have to redeem it to save\nhimself from that disgrace; and the poor pawnbroker will get his money\nback. Nobody would buy it, you know.\n\nTHE INCA. May I ask why?\n\nERMYNTRUDL. Well, look at it! Just look at it! I ask you!\n\nTHE INCA [his moustache drooping ominously]. I am sorry to have to\nreport to the Inca that you have no soul for fine art. [He rises\nsulkily.] The position of daughter-in-law to the Inca is not compatible\nwith the tastes of a pig. [He attempts to take back the brooch.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [rising and retreating behind her chair with the brooch].\nHere! you let that brooch alone. You presented it to me on behalf of the\nInca. It is mine. You said my appearance was satisfactory.\n\nTHE INCA. Your appearance is not satisfactory. The Inca would not allow\nhis son to marry you if the boy were on a desert island and you were the\nonly other human being on it [he strides up the room.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [calmly sitting down and replacing the case on the table].\nHow could he? There would be no clergyman to marry us. It would have to\nbe quite morganatic.\n\nTHE INCA [returning]. Such an expression is out of place in the mouth of\na princess aspiring to the highest destiny on earth. You have the morals\nof a dragoon. [She receives this with a shriek of laughter. He struggles\nwith his sense of humor.] At the same time [he sits down] there is a\ncertain coarse fun in the idea which compels me to smile [he turns up\nhis moustache and smiles.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. When I marry the Inca's son, Captain, I shall make the Inca\norder you to cut off that moustache. It is too irresistible. Doesn't it\nfascinate everyone in Perusalem?\n\nTHE INCA [leaning forward to her energetically]. By all the thunders of\nThor, madam, it fascinates the whole world.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. What I like about you, Captain Duval, is your modesty.\n\nTHE INCA [straightening up suddenly]. Woman, do not be a fool.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [indignant]. Well!\n\nTHE INCA. You must look facts in the face. This moustache is an exact\ncopy of the Inca's moustache. Well, does the world occupy itself with\nthe Inca's moustache or does it not? Does it ever occupy itself with\nanything else? If that is the truth, does its recognition constitute\nthe Inca a coxcomb? Other potentates have moustaches: even beards\nand moustaches. Does the world occupy itself with those beards and\nmoustaches? Do the hawkers in the streets of every capital on the\ncivilized globe sell ingenious cardboard representations of their faces\non which, at the pulling of a simple string, the moustaches turn up and\ndown, so--[he makes his moustache turn, up and down several times]? No!\nI say No. The Inca's moustache is so watched and studied that it has\nmade his face the political barometer of the whole continent. When that\nmoustache goes up, culture rises with it. Not what you call culture;\nbut Kultur, a word so much more significant that I hardly understand\nit myself except when I am in specially good form. When it goes down,\nmillions of men perish.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You know, if I had a moustache like that, it would turn my\nhead. I should go mad. Are you quite sure the Inca isn't mad?\n\nTHE INCA. How can he be mad, madam? What is sanity? The condition of the\nInca's mind. What is madness? The condition of the people who disagree\nwith the Inca.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Then I am a lunatic because I don't like that ridiculous\nbrooch.\n\nTHE INCA. No, madam: you are only an idiot.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Thank you.\n\nTHE INCA. Mark you: It is not to be expected that you should see eye to\neye with the Inca. That would be presumption. It is for you to accept\nwithout question or demur the assurance of your Inca that the brooch is\na masterpiece.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. MY Inca! Oh, come! I like that. He is not my Inca yet.\n\nTHE INCA. He is everybody's Inca, madam. His realm will yet extend to\nthe confines of the habitable earth. It is his divine right; and let\nthose who dispute it look to themselves. Properly speaking, all those\nwho are now trying to shake his world predominance are not at war with\nhim, but in rebellion against him.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well, he started it, you know.\n\nTHE INCA. Madam, be just. When the hunters surround the lion, the lion\nwill spring. The Inca had kept the peace of years. Those who attacked\nhim were steeped in blood, black blood, white blood, brown blood, yellow\nblood, blue blood. The Inca had never shed a drop.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. He had only talked.\n\nTHE INCA. Only TALKED! ONLY talked! What is more glorious than talk? Can\nanyone in the world talk like him? Madam, when he signed the declaration\nof war, he said to his foolish generals and admirals, 'Gentlemen, you\nwill all be sorry for this.' And they are. They know now that they had\nbetter have relied on the sword of the spirit: in other words, on their\nInca's talk, than on their murderous cannons. The world will one day do\njustice to the Inca as the man who kept the peace with nothing but his\ntongue and his moustache. While he talked: talked just as I am talking\nnow to you, simply, quietly, sensibly, but GREATLY, there was peace;\nthere was prosperity; Perusalem went from success to success. He has\nbeen silenced for a year by the roar of trinitrotoluene and the bluster\nof fools; and the world is in ruins. What a tragedy! [He is convulsed\nwith grief.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Captain Duval, I don't want to be unsympathetic; but suppose\nwe get back to business.\n\nTHE INCA. Business! What business?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well, MY business. You want me to marry one of the Inca's\nsons: I forget which.\n\nTHE INCA. As far as I can recollect the name, it is His Imperial\nHighness Prince Eitel William Frederick George Franz Josef Alexander\nNicholas Victor Emmanuel Albert Theodore Wilson--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [interrupting]. Oh, please, please, mayn't I have one with a\nshorter name? What is he called at home?\n\nTHE INCA. He is usually called Sonny, madam. [With great charm of\nmanner.] But you will please understand that the Inca has no desire to\npin you to any particular son. There is Chips and Spots and Lulu and\nPongo and the Corsair and the Piffler and Jack Johnson the Second,\nall unmarried. At least not seriously married: nothing, in short, that\ncannot be arranged. They are all at your service.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Are they all as clever and charming as their father?\n\nTHE INCA [lifts his eyebrows pityingly; shrugs his shoulders; then,\nwith indulgent paternal contempt]. Excellent lads, madam. Very honest\naffectionate creatures. I have nothing against them. Pongo imitates\nfarmyard sounds--cock crowing and that sort of thing--extremely well.\nLulu plays Strauss's Sinfonia Domestica on the mouth organ really\nscreamingly. Chips keeps owls and rabbits. Spots motor bicycles. The\nCorsair commands canal barges and steers them himself. The Piffler\nwrites plays, and paints most abominably. Jack Johnson trims ladies'\nhats, and boxes with professionals hired for that purpose. He is\ninvariably victorious. Yes: they all have their different little\ntalents. And also, of course, their family resemblances. For example,\nthey all smoke; they all quarrel with one another; and they none of them\nappreciate their father, who, by the way, is no mean painter, though the\nPiffler pretends to ridicule his efforts.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Quite a large choice, eh?\n\nTHE INCA. But very little to choose, believe me. I should not recommend\nPongo, because he snores so frightfully that it has been necessary to\nbuild him a sound-proof bedroom: otherwise the royal family would get no\nsleep. But any of the others would suit equally well--if you are really\nbent on marrying one of them.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. If! What is this? I never wanted to marry one of them. I\nthought you wanted me to.\n\nTHE INCA. I did, madam; but [confidentially, flattering her] you are not\nquite the sort of person I expected you to be; and I doubt whether\nany of these young degenerates would make you happy. I trust I am not\nshowing any want of natural feeling when I say that from the point of\nview of a lively, accomplished, and beautiful woman [Ermyntrude bows]\nthey might pall after a time. I suggest that you might prefer the Inca\nhimself.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh, Captain, how could a humble person like myself be of\nany interest to a prince who is surrounded with the ablest and most\nfar-reaching intellects in the world?\n\nTAE INCA [explosively]. What on earth are you talking about, madam? Can\nyou name a single man in the entourage of the Inca who is not a born\nfool?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh, how can you say that! There is Admiral von Cockpits--\n\nTHE INCA [rising intolerantly and striding about the room]. Von\nCockpits! Madam, if Von Cockpits ever goes to heaven, before three weeks\nare over the Angel Gabriel will be at war with the man in the moon.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. But General Von Schinkenburg--\n\nTHE INCA. Schinkenburg! I grant you, Schinkenburg has a genius for\ndefending market gardens. Among market gardens he is invincible. But\nwhat is the good of that? The world does not consist of market gardens.\nTurn him loose in pasture and he is lost. The Inca has defeated all\nthese generals again and again at manoeuvres; and yet he has to\ngive place to them in the field because he would be blamed for every\ndisaster--accused of sacrificing the country to his vanity. Vanity! Why\ndo they call him vain? Just because he is one of the few men who are not\nafraid to live. Why do they call themselves brave? Because they have\nnot sense enough to be afraid to die. Within the last year the world\nhas produced millions of heroes. Has it produced more than one Inca? [He\nresumes his seat.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Fortunately not, Captain. I'd rather marry Chips.\n\nTHE INCA [making a wry face]. Chips! Oh no: I wouldn't marry Chips.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Why?\n\nTHE INCA [whispering the secret]. Chips talks too much about himself.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well, what about Snooks?\n\nTHE INCA. Snooks? Who is he? Have I a son named Snooks? There are so\nmany--[wearily] so many--that I often forget. [Casually.] But I wouldn't\nmarry him, anyhow, if I were you.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. But hasn't any of them inherited the family genius? Surely,\nif Providence has entrusted them with the care of Perusalem--if they are\nall descended from Bedrock the Great--\n\nTHE INCA [interrupting her impatiently]. Madam, if you ask me, I\nconsider Bedrock a grossly overrated monarch.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [shocked]. Oh, Captain! Take care! Incadisparagement.\n\nTHE INCA. I repeat, grossly overrated. Strictly between ourselves, I\ndo not believe all this about Providence entrusting the care of sixty\nmillion human beings to the abilities of Chips and the Piffler and Jack\nJohnson. I believe in individual genius. That is the Inca's secret. It\nmust be. Why, hang it all, madam, if it were a mere family matter, the\nInca's uncle would have been as great a man as the Inca. And--well,\neverybody knows what the Inca's uncle was.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. My experience is that the relatives of men of genius are\nalways the greatest duffers imaginable.\n\nTHE INCA. Precisely. That is what proves that the Inca is a man of\ngenius. His relatives ARE duffers.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. But bless my soul, Captain, if all the Inca's generals are\nincapables, and all his relatives duffers, Perusalem will be beaten in\nthe war; and then it will become a republic, like France after 1871, and\nthe Inca will be sent to St Helena.\n\nTHE INCA [triumphantly]. That is just what the Inca is playing for,\nmadam. It is why he consented to the war.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. What!\n\nTHE INCA. Aha! The fools talk of crushing the Inca; but they little know\ntheir man. Tell me this. Why did St Helena extinguish Napoleon?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I give it up.\n\nTHE INCA. Because, madam, with certain rather remarkable qualities,\nwhich I should be the last to deny, Napoleon lacked versatility. After\nall, any fool can be a soldier: we know that only too well in Perusalem,\nwhere every fool is a soldier. But the Inca has a thousand other\nresources. He is an architect. Well, St Helena presents an unlimited\nfield to the architect. He is a painter: need I remind you that St\nHelena is still without a National Gallery? He is a composer: Napoleon\nleft no symphonies in St Helena. Send the Inca to St Helena, madam,\nand the world will crowd thither to see his works as they crowd now to\nAthens to see the Acropolis, to Madrid to see the pictures of Velasquez,\nto Bayreuth to see the music dramas of that egotistical old rebel\nRichard Wagner, who ought to have been shot before he was forty, as\nindeed he very nearly was. Take this from me: hereditary monarchs are\nplayed out: the age for men of genius has come: the career is open to\nthe talents: before ten years have elapsed every civilized country from\nthe Carpathians to the Rocky Mountains will be a Republic.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Then goodbye to the Inca.\n\nTHE INCA. On the contrary, madam, the Inca will then have his first real\nchance. He will be unanimously invited by those Republics to return from\nhis exile and act as Superpresident of all the republics.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. But won't that be a come-down for him? Think of it! after\nbeing Inca, to be a mere President!\n\nTHE INCA. Well, why not! An Inca can do nothing. He is tied hand and\nfoot. A constitutional monarch is openly called an India-rubber stamp.\nAn emperor is a puppet. The Inca is not allowed to make a speech: he\nis compelled to take up a screed of flatulent twaddle written by\nsome noodle of a minister and read it aloud. But look at the American\nPresident! He is the Allerhochst, if you like. No, madam, believe me,\nthere is nothing like Democracy, American Democracy. Give the people\nvoting papers: good long voting papers, American fashion; and while the\npeople are reading the voting papers the Government does what it likes.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. What! You too worship before the statue of Liberty, like the\nAmericans?\n\nTHE INCA. Not at all, madam. The Americans do not worship the statue\nof Liberty. They have erected it in the proper place for a statue of\nLiberty: on its tomb [he turns down his moustaches.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [laughing]. Oh! You'd better not let them hear you say that,\nCaptain.\n\nTHE INCA. Quite safe, madam: they would take it as a joke. [He rises.]\nAnd now, prepare yourself for a surprise. [She rises]. A shock. Brace\nyourself. Steel yourself. And do not be afraid.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Whatever on earth can you be going to tell me, Captain?\n\nTHE INCA. Madam, I am no captain. I--\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You are the Inca in disguise.\n\nTHE INCA. Good heavens! how do you know that? Who has betrayed me?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. How could I help divining it, Sir? Who is there in the world\nlike you? Your magnetism--\n\nTHE INCA. True: I had forgotten my magnetism. But you know now that\nbeneath the trappings of Imperial Majesty there is a Man: simple, frank,\nmodest, unaffected, colloquial: a sincere friend, a natural human being,\na genial comrade, one eminently calculated to make a woman happy. You,\non the other hand, are the most charming woman I have ever met. Your\nconversation is wonderful. I have sat here almost in silence, listening\nto your shrewd and penetrating account of my character, my motives, if I\nmay say so, my talents. Never has such justice been done me: never have\nI experienced such perfect sympathy. Will you--I hardly know how to put\nthis--will you be mine?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh, Sir, you are married.\n\nTHE INCA. I am prepared to embrace the Mahometan faith, which allows a\nman four wives, if you will consent. It will please the Turks. But I had\nrather you did not mention it to the Inca-ess. If you don't mind.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. This is really charming of you. But the time has come for\nme to make a revelation. It is your Imperial Majesty's turn now to brace\nyourself. To steel yourself. I am not the princess. I am--\n\nTHE INCA. The daughter of my old friend Archdeacon Daffodil Donkin,\nwhose sermons are read to me every evening after dinner. I never forget\na face.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You knew all along!\n\nTHE INCA [bitterly, throwing himself into his chair]. And you supposed\nthat I, who have been condemned to the society of princesses all my\nwretched life, believed for a moment that any princess that ever walked\ncould have your intelligence!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. How clever of you, Sir! But you cannot afford to marry me.\n\nTHE INCA [springing up]. Why not?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You are too poor. You have to eat war bread. Kings nowadays\nbelong to the poorer classes. The King of England does not even allow\nhimself wine at dinner.\n\nTHE INCA [delighted]. Haw! Ha ha! Haw! haw! [He is convulsed with\nlaughter, and, finally has to relieve his feelings by waltzing half round\nthe room.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You may laugh, Sir; but I really could not live in that\nstyle. I am the widow of a millionaire, ruined by your little war.\n\nTHE INCA. A millionaire! What are millionaires now, with the world\ncrumbling?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Excuse me: mine was a hyphenated millionaire.\n\nTHE INCA. A highfalutin millionaire, you mean. [Chuckling]. Haw! ha ha!\nreally very nearly a pun, that. [He sits down in her chair.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [revolted, sinking into his chair]. I think it quite the\nworst pun I ever heard.\n\nTHE INCA. The best puns have all been made years ago: nothing remained\nbut to achieve the worst. However, madam [he rises majestically; and she\nis about to rise also]. No: I prefer a seated audience [she falls back\ninto her seat at the imperious wave of his hand]. So [he clicks his\nheels]. Madam, I recognize my presumption in having sought the honor\nof your hand. As you say, I cannot afford it. Victorious as I am, I am\nhopelessly bankrupt; and the worst of it is, I am intelligent enough\nto know it. And I shall be beaten in consequence, because my most\nimplacable enemy, though only a few months further away from bankruptcy\nthan myself, has not a ray of intelligence, and will go on fighting\nuntil civilization is destroyed, unless I, out of sheer pity for the\nworld, condescend to capitulate.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The sooner the better, Sir. Many fine young men are dying\nwhile you wait.\n\nTHE INCA [flinching painfully]. Why? Why do they do it?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Because you make them.\n\nTHE INCA. Stuff! How can I? I am only one man; and they are millions.\nDo you suppose they would really kill each other if they didn't want\nto, merely for the sake of my beautiful eyes? Do not be deceived by\nnewspaper claptrap, madam. I was swept away by a passion not my own,\nwhich imposed itself on me. By myself I am nothing. I dare not walk down\nthe principal street of my own capital in a coat two years old, though\nthe sweeper of that street can wear one ten years old. You talk of\ndeath as an unpopular thing. You are wrong: for years I gave them art,\nliterature, science, prosperity, that they might live more abundantly;\nand they hated me, ridiculed me, caricatured me. Now that I give them\ndeath in its frightfullest forms, they are devoted to me. If you doubt\nme, ask those who for years have begged our taxpayers in vain for a\nfew paltry thousands to spend on Life: on the bodies and minds of the\nnation's children, on the beauty and healthfulness of its cities, on\nthe honor and comfort of its worn-out workers. They refused: and because\nthey refused, death is let loose on them. They grudged a few hundreds\na year for their salvation: they now pay millions a day for their own\ndestruction and damnation. And this they call my doing! Let them say it,\nif they dare, before the judgment-seat at which they and I shall answer\nat last for what we have left undone no less than for what we have done.\n[Pulling himself together suddenly.] Madam, I have the honor to be your\nmost obedient [he clicks his heels and bows].\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Sir! [She curtsies.]\n\nTHE INCA [turning at the door]. Oh, by the way, there is a princess,\nisn't there, somewhere on the premises?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. There is. Shall I fetch her?\n\nTHE INCA [dubious], Pretty awful, I suppose, eh?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. About the usual thing.\n\nTHE INCA [sighing]. Ah well! What can one expect? I don't think I need\ntrouble her personally. Will you explain to her about the boys?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I am afraid the explanation will fall rather flat without\nyour magnetism.\n\nTHE INCA [returning to her and speaking very humanly]. You are making\nfun of me. Why does everybody make fun of me? Is it fair?\n\nERMYNTRUDE [seriously]. Yes, it is fair. What other defence have we poor\ncommon people against your shining armor, your mailed fist, your pomp\nand parade, your terrible power over us? Are these things fair?\n\nTHE INCA. Ah, well, perhaps, perhaps. [He looks at his watch.] By the\nway, there is time for a drive round the town and a cup of tea at the\nZoo. Quite a bearable band there: it does not play any patriotic airs.\nI am sorry you will not listen to any more permanent arrangement; but if\nyou would care to come--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [eagerly]. Ratherrrrrr. I shall be delighted.\n\nTHE INCA [cautiously]. In the strictest honor, you understand.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Don't be afraid. I promise to refuse any incorrect\nproposals.\n\nTHE INCA [enchanted]. Oh! Charming woman: how well you understand men!\n\nHe offers her his arm: they go out together.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Inca of Perusalem, by George Bernard Shaw"}
