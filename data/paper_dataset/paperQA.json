        "title": "Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for System 2 Planning",
        "introduction": "Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach to planning, enabling the generation of complex trajectories by modeling trajectory distributions using large-scale offline data (Janner et al., 2022; Ajay et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a, c, b). Unlike traditional autoregressive planning methods, diffusion-based planners, such as Diffuser (Janner et al., 2022), generate entire trajectories holistically through a series of denoising steps, eliminating the need for a forward dynamics model. This approach effectively addresses key limitations of forward models, such as poor long-term dependency modeling and error accumulation (Hafner et al., 2022; Hamed et al., 2024), making it particularly well-suited for planning tasks with long horizons or sparse rewards.\n\nDespite their strengths, it remains uncertain how diffusion-based planners can effectively enhance planning accuracy through the computation scaling on the inference time—a property referred to as inference-time scalability. One potential approach is to increase the number of denoising steps or, alternatively, draw additional samples (Zhou et al., 2024). However, it is known that performance gains from increasing denoising steps plateau quickly (Karras et al., 2022; Song et al., 2021a, b), and independent random searches with multiple samples are highly inefficient as they fail to leverage information from other samples. Moreover, how to effectively manage the exploration-exploitation tradeoff within this framework also remains unclear.\n\nIn contrast, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Coulom, 2007), a widely adopted planning method, demonstrates robust inference-time scalability. By leveraging iterative simulations, MCTS refines decisions and adapts based on exploratory feedback, making it highly effective in improving planning accuracy as more computation is allocated. This capability has established MCTS as a cornerstone in many System 2 reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving (Guan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024a) and program synthesis (Brandfonbrener et al., 2024). However, unlike diffusion-based planners, traditional MCTS relies on a forward model for tree rollouts, inheriting its limitations including losing global consistency. In addition to being restricted to discrete action spaces, the resulting search tree can grow excessively large in both depth and width. This leads to significant computational demands, particularly in scenarios involving long horizons and large action spaces.\n\nThis raises a crucial question: how can we combine the strengths of Diffuser and MCTS to overcome their limitations and enhance the inference-time scalability of diffusion-based planning? To address this, we propose Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a framework that integrates diffusion-based trajectory generation with the iterative search capabilities of MCTS for more efficient and scalable planning.\n\nMCTD builds on three key innovations. First, it restructures denoising into a tree-based rollout process, enabling semi-autoregressive causal planning while maintaining trajectory coherence. Second, it introduces guidance levels as meta-actions to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring adaptive and scalable trajectory refinement within the diffusion framework. Third, it employs fast jumpy denoising as a simulation mechanism, efficiently estimating trajectory quality without costly forward model rollouts. These innovations enable the four steps of MCTS (Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation) within diffusion planning, effectively bridging structured search with generative modeling. Experimental results show that MCTD outperforms existing approaches in long-horizon tasks, achieving superior scalability and solution quality.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an MCTS-integrated diffusion planning framework that explicitly incorporates the four steps of MCTS, providing an effective inference-time scaling method for diffusion models. Second, we introduce three key innovations: Denoising as Tree-Rollout, Guidance Levels as Meta-Actions, and Jumpy Denoising as Fast Simulation. Lastly, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of MCTD.",

        "title": "An Analysis for Reasoning Bias of Language Models with Small Initialization",
        "introduction": "With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of tasks, from text generation to complex reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a; Achiam et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024). Reasoning, in particular, is a critical ability for LLMs. A number of studies have focused on improving the reasoning ability of these models through data-driven approaches, such as RHO-1 (Lin et al., 2024) and Phi-4 (Abdin et al., 2024). However, there remains an ongoing debate as to whether LLMs genuinely learn the underlying logical rules or merely mimic patterns observed in the data (Marcus, 2003; Smolensky et al., 2022).\n\nAn alternative approach to enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs focuses on the model architecture and its training process. In one such study examining the use of Transformers to model compositional functions, it was observed that the scale of model parameter initialization significantly impacts the model’s reasoning behavior (Zhang et al., 2024a, 2025). Specifically, smaller initialization scales bias the model toward fitting the data by learning primitive-level functions and compositional rules, whereas larger initialization scales tend to encourage memorization of input-output mappings. A qualitative rationale for this phenomenon has been proposed: with a small initialization, a well-documented effect known as neuron condensation emerges during training (Xu et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Zhang & Xu, 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhang & Xu, 2024). This phenomenon suggests that neurons within the same layer tend to behave similarly, promoting data fitting with the least possible complexity. To achieve a low-complexity result, the model must learn a minimal set of rules leading to capture the intrinsic primitive functions and compositional rules. However, this rationale does not reveal a critical question: how the optimization process, together with the Transformer structure, can achieve reasoning solutions with small initialization?\n\nIn this work, we identify a reasoning bias during the training of neural networks that learn natural language when initialized with small parameter scales. To illustrate this phenomenon, we employ a GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019) to train on a mixed dataset comprising two types of language data with distinct levels of reasoning complexity, within a single next-token prediction training framework. The first dataset, PrOntoQA (Saparov & He, 2023), consists of question-answering examples that include chains of thought, which explicitly describe the reasoning necessary to answer the questions correctly. The second dataset, TinyStories (Eldan & Li, 2023), is a synthetic corpus of short stories containing only words typically understood by children aged 3 to 4 years. As shown in Figure 1, the training loss for PrOntoQA decreases significantly faster than for TinyStories, suggesting that the model encounters and learns the reasoning patterns more readily.\n\nWe uncover a key mechanism whereby reasoning tasks are learned earlier during training because the tokens associated with these tasks become more differentiated in the embedding space at an early stage of the training process. We validate this mechanism using both synthetic data and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the evolution of token embeddings, which depends on the distribution of sample labels. Since each token is encoded as a one-hot vector, its embedding is adjusted based on the loss associated with the labels of that token. Consequently, different label distributions can lead to distinct learning behaviors for token embeddings. For memory tasks, the labels associated with each token are typically random and lack explicit structure, which results in similar distributions for different memory token labels. As a result, the embeddings for memory tokens are difficult to differentiate in the early stages of training. In contrast, reasoning tokens often exhibit distinct label distributions, leading to more differentiated embedding vectors for these tokens. These insights are elaborated through a simplified model using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and embedding structure, followed by an analysis of a Transformer model.\n\nThe primary contribution of this research lies in uncovering the impact of the parameter initialization scale on the training behavior and task preferences of LLMs. By combining theoretical analysis with empirical evidence, we enhance the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provide new insights for optimizing model initialization strategies.",

        "title": "Training Dynamics of In-Context Learning in Linear Attention",
        "introduction": "Self-attention-based models, such as transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), exhibit a remarkable ability known as in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020). That is, these models can solve unseen tasks based on exemplars in the context of an input prompt. In-context learning (ICL) is critical to the flexibility of large language models, allowing them to solve tasks not explicitly included in their training data. However, it remains unclear how architectures like self-attention acquire this ability through gradient descent training.\n\nSeminal work by Olsson et al. (2022) identified an intriguing trait in the training dynamics of ICL: the ICL ability often emerges abruptly, coinciding with an abrupt drop in loss during training. This abrupt learning phase can reflect the formation of an induction head in the ICL setting (Olsson et al., 2022; Reddy, 2024; Singh et al., 2024; Edelman et al., 2024), and can also occur more broadly in transformer training dynamics (Nanda et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024a; Hoffmann et al., 2024). Furthermore, Singh et al. (2023) found that ICL may often be a transient ability that the transformers acquire and then lose over the course of long training time, a phenomenon that has since been reproduced in many settings (He et al., 2024; Anand et al., 2025; Chan et al., 2025; Nguyen & Reddy, 2025; Park et al., 2025; Singh et al., 2025). These findings underscore the importance of understanding not only the ICL ability in trained models, but its full training dynamics.\n\nThis work aims to provide a theoretical description of how the ICL ability evolves in gradient descent training. To do so, we consider the increasingly common setup of linear attention1 (Von Oswald et al., 2023) trained on an in-context linear regression task (Garg et al., 2022). The in-context linear regression task, in which the model needs to perform linear regression on the data in context, is a canonical instantiation of ICL (Garg et al., 2022; Akyürek et al., 2023; Von Oswald et al., 2023; Ahn et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023). The linear attention model, which has been used in many prior studies (Schlag et al., 2021; Von Oswald et al., 2023; Ahn et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2024; Mahankali et al., 2024; Duraisamy, 2024; Li et al., 2024; Yau et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024; Frei & Vardi, 2025), reproduces key optimization properties of practical transformers (Ahn et al., 2024) and is more amenable to theoretical analysis. Importantly, despite its name, linear attention is a nonlinear model, as it removes the softmax operation but is still a nonlinear function of the input.\n\nWe study two common parametrizations of multi-head linear attention: (i) ATTN_M, linear attention where the key and query matrices in each head are merged into a single matrix, a reparametrization procedure widely used in theoretical studies on transformers (Ahn et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2023; Ataee Tarzanagh et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a, b; Chen et al., 2024b; Wu et al., 2024; Kim & Suzuki, 2024; Huang et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024b; Ildiz et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2024; Tarzanagh et al., 2024; Vasudeva et al., 2025; Lu et al., 2024; Chen & Li, 2024; Julistiono et al., 2024; Yau et al., 2024; Anwar et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025a); (ii) ATTN_s, linear attention with separate key and query matrices, which is closer to the implementation of attention in real-world transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). We specify the fixed points in the loss landscapes, as well as how gradient descent training dynamics traverses the landscape. Our findings are summarized as follows.\n\n• We find two fixed points in the training dynamics of ATTN_M, and exponentially many fixed points in that of ATTN_S.\n\n• We show a single, abrupt loss drop in training ATTN_M from small initialization and derive an analytical time-course solution when the input token covariance is white. We show saddle-to-saddle training dynamics in training ATTN_S\n from small initialization and reduce the high-dimensional training dynamics to scalar ordinary differential equations through an ansatz. We demonstrate the rank of the separate key and query weights affects the dynamics by shortening the duration of certain plateaus.\n\n• We identify the in-context algorithm of the converged and early stopped models. When ATTN_M and ATTN_S are trained to convergence, they approximately implement least squares linear regression in context. When the training of ATTN_S early stops during the (m+1)-th loss plateau, it approximately implements principal component regression in context with the first m principal components.\n\n• As a tool for our analysis, we show that when trained on in-context linear regression tasks, ATTN_M is equivalent to a two-layer fully-connected linear network with a cubic feature map as input, and ATTN_S is equivalent to a sum of three-layer convolutional linear networks with the same cubic feature map as input.\n\n• We empirically demonstrate that the single and multiple loss drops also occur in softmax ATTN_M and ATTN_S, respectively.\n\nComparing the two models, we find that the ICL ability evolves differently in them: ATTN_M acquires the in-context linear regression ability through one abrupt loss drop, while ATTN_S acquires this ability by progressively improving on in-context principal component regression. This makes a theoretical case for the progressive improvements of ICL in gradient descent training. Our results also reveal how parametrization, such as merged versus separate key and query and the rank of the separate key and query weights, influences the loss landscape and training dynamics. This motivates future research to take the parametrization factor into account when studying the landscape and dynamics of attention models.",

        "introduction": "Generative models for continuous domains have enabled numerous applications in images (Rombach et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022; Esser et al., 2024), videos (Ho et al., 2022a; Blattmann et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2024), and audio (Chen et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023), yet achieving high-fidelity outputs, efficient inference, and stable training remains a core challenge — a trilemma that continues to motivate research in this domain. Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020b), one of the leading techniques, require many inference steps for high-quality results, while step-reduction methods, such as diffusion distillation (Yin et al., 2024; Sauer et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024a) and Consistency Models (Song et al., 2023; Geng et al., 2024; Lu & Song, 2024; Kim et al., 2023), often risk training collapse without careful tuning and regularization (such as pre-generating data-noise pair and early stopping).\n\nTo address the aforementioned trilemma, we introduce Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a stable, single-stage training procedure that learns generative models from scratch for single- or multi-step inference. IMM operates on the time-dependent marginal distributions of stochastic interpolants (Albergo et al., 2023) — continuous-time stochastic processes that connect two arbitrary probability density functions (data at t=0 and prior at t=1). By learning a (stochastic or deterministic) mapping from any marginal at time t=1 to any marginal at time s<t, it can naturally support one- or multi-step generation (Figure 2).\n\nIMM models can be trained efficiently from mathematical induction. For time s<r<t, we form two distributions at s by running a one-step IMM from samples at r and t. We then minimize their divergence, enforcing that the distributions at s are close to the distributions at r. This construction by induction guarantees convergence to the data distribution. To help with training stability, we model IMM based on certain stochastic interpolants and optimize the objective with stable sample-based divergence estimators such as moment matching (Gretton et al., 2012). Notably, we prove that Consistency Models (CMs) are a single-particle, first-moment matching special case of IMM, which partially explains the training instability of CMs.\n\nOn ImageNet-256x256, IMM surpasses diffusion models and achieves 1.99 FID with only 8 inference steps using standard transformer architectures. On CIFAR-10, IMM similarly achieves state-of-the-art of 1.98 FID with 2-step generation for a model trained from scratch.",

        "title": "Statistical Test for Feature Selection Pipelines by Selective Inference",
        "introduction": "In practical data-driven decision-making tasks, integrating various types of data analysis steps is crucial for addressing diverse challenges. For instance, in genetic research aimed at identifying genes linked to a specific disease, the process often begins with preprocessing tasks such as filling in missing values and detecting outliers. This is followed by screening for potentially related genes using simple descriptive statistics and then applying more complex machine learning-based feature selection algorithms. Such a systematic sequence of steps designed to analyze data and derive useful insights is known as a data analysis pipeline, which plays a key role in ensuring the reproducibility and reliability of data-driven decision-making.\n\nIn this study, as an example of data analysis pipelines, we consider a class of feature selection pipelines that integrates various missing-value imputations (MVI) algorithms, outlier detection (OD) algorithms, and feature selection (FS) algorithms. Figure 1 shows examples of two such pipelines. The pipeline on the left starts with a mean value imputation algorithm, followed by L1 regression based OD algorithm, proceeds with marginal screening to refine feature candidates, and concludes by using two FS algorithms—stepwise feature selection and Lasso—selecting their union as the final features. The pipeline on the right initiates with regression imputation, continues with marginal screening to narrow down feature candidates, uses Cook’s distance for OD, and applies both stepwise FS and Lasso, ultimately choosing the intersection of their results as the final features.\n\nWhen a data-driven approach is used for high-stakes decision-making tasks such as medical diagnosis, it is crucial to quantify the reliability of the final results by considering all steps in the pipeline. The goal of this study is to develop a statistical test for a specific class of feature selection pipelines, allowing the statistical significance of features obtained through the pipeline to be properly quantified in the form of p-values. The first technical challenge in achieving this is the need to appropriately account for the complex interrelations between pipeline components to determine the overall statistical significance. The second challenge is to develop a universal framework capable of performing statistical tests on arbitrary pipelines (within a given class) rather than creating individual tests for each pipeline.\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce the concept of selective inference (SI) (Taylor and Tibshirani, 2015; Fithian et al., 2015; Lee and Taylor, 2014), a novel statistical inference approach that has gained significant attention over the past decade. The core idea of SI is to characterize the process of selecting hypotheses from the data and calculate the corresponding p-values using the sampling distribution, conditional on this selection process. We propose an approach based on SI that provides valid p-values for any feature selection pipeline configuration within the aforementioned class. We also introduce a modular implementation framework that supports SI for any pipeline configuration within this class without requiring additional implementation efforts1. Specifically, with our framework, the statistical significance of features from any pipeline in this class can be quantified as valid p-values when used in a linear model, with no extra implementation required beyond specifying the pipeline.\n\nWe note that our long-term goal beyond this current study is to ensure the reproducibility of data-driven decision-making by accounting for the entire pipeline from raw data to the final results, with the current study on a class of feature selection pipelines serving as a proof of concept for that goal.",

        "title": "Human Expertise in Algorithmic Prediction",
        "introduction": "Despite remarkable advances in machine learning, human judgment continues to play a critical role in many high-stakes prediction tasks. For example, consider the problem of triage in the emergency room, where healthcare providers assess and prioritize patients for immediate care. On one hand, prognostic algorithms offer significant promise for improving triage decisions; indeed, algorithmic predictions are often more accurate than even expert human decision makers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. On the other hand, predictive algorithms may fail to fully capture the relevant context for each individual. For example, an algorithmic risk score may only have access to tabular electronic health records or other structured data (e.g., medical imaging), while a physician has access to many additional modalities—not least of which is the ability to directly examine the patient!\n\nThese two observations—that algorithms often outperform humans, but humans often have access to a richer information set—are not in conflict with each other. Indeed, [9] find exactly this phenomenon in an analysis of emergency room triage decisions. This suggests that, even in settings where algorithms outperform humans, algorithms might still benefit from some form of human input. Ideally this collaboration will yield human-AI complementarity [10, 11], in which a joint system outperforms either a human or algorithm working alone. Our work thus begins with the following question:\n\nWhen (and how) can human judgment improve the predictions of any learning algorithm?\n\nExample: X-ray classification. Consider the problem of diagnosing atelectasis (a partially or fully collapsed lung; we study this task in detail in Section 5). Today’s state-of-the-art deep learning models can perform well on these kinds of classification tasks using only a patient’s chest X-ray as input [12, 13, 14]. We are interested in whether we can further improve these algorithmic predictions by incorporating a “second opinion” from a physician, particularly because the physician may have access to information (e.g., by directly observing the patient) which is not present in the X-ray.\n\nA first heuristic, without making any assumptions about the available predictive models, is to ask whether a physician can distinguish patients whose imaging data are identical. For example, if a physician can correctly indicate that one patient is suffering from atelectasis while another is not—despite the patients having identical chest X-rays—the physician must have information that the X-ray does not capture. In principle, this could form the basis for a statistical test: we could ask whether the physician performs better than random in distinguishing a large number of such patients. If so, even a predictive algorithm which outperforms the physician might benefit from human input.\n\nOf course, we are unlikely to find identical observations in continuous-valued and/or high-dimensional data (like X-rays). A natural relaxation is to instead consider observations which are sufficiently “similar”, as suggested by [9]. In this work we propose a more general notion of algorithmic indistinguishability, or coarser subsets of inputs in which no algorithm (in some rich, user-defined class) has significant predictive power. We show that these subsets can be discovered via a novel connection to multicalibration [15], and formally demonstrate that using human feedback to predict outcomes within these subsets can outperform any algorithmic predictor (in the same user-defined class). In addition to being tractable, this framework is relevant from a decision-theoretic perspective: although we’ve focused thus far on algorithms’ fundamental informational constraints, it is also natural to ask whether an expert provides signal which is merely difficult for an algorithm to learn directly (due to e.g., limited training data or computational constraints). Our approach naturally interpolates between these contexts by defining indistinguishability with respect to whichever class of models is practically relevant for a given prediction task. We elaborate on these contributions below.\n\nContributions. We propose a novel framework for human-AI collaboration in prediction tasks. Our approach uses human feedback to refine predictions within sets of inputs which are algorithmically indistinguishable, or “look the same” to predictive algorithms. In Section 4 we present a simple method to incorporate this feedback only when it improves on the best feasible predictive model (and precisely quantify this improvement). This extends the “omnipredictors” result of [16] in the special case of squared error, which may be of independent interest.1 In Section 5 we present experiments demonstrating that although humans fail to outperform algorithmic predictors on average, there exist specific (algorithmically indistinguishable) instances on which humans are more accurate than the best available predictor (and these instances are identifiable ex ante).2 In Section 6 we consider the complementary setting in which an algorithm provides recommendations to many downstream users, who independently choose when to comply. We provide conditions under which a predictor is robust to these compliance patterns, and thus be simultaneously optimal for all downstream users.",

        "title": "Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time",
        "introduction": "Interactive preference learning from human binary choices is widely used in recommender systems [32, 56, 9, 21], assistive robots [54, 65], and fine-tuning large language models [59, 43, 46, 47, 5]. This process is often framed as a preference-based bandit problem [7, 31], where the system repeatedly presents queries as pairs of options, the human selects a preferred option, and the system infers preferences from these choices. Binary choices are popular because they are easy to implement and impose low cognitive load on users [74, 72, 37]. However, while binary choices reveal preferences, they provide little information about preference strength [77]. To address this, researchers have incorporated additional explicit human feedback, such as ratings [58, 50], labels [74], and slider bars [72, 5], but these approaches often complicate interfaces and increase cognitive demands [36, 37].\n\nIn this paper, we propose leveraging implicit human feedback, specifically response times, to provide additional insights into preference strength. Unlike explicit feedback, response time is unobtrusive and effortless to measure [17], offering valuable information that complements binary choices [16, 2]. For instance, consider an online retailer that repeatedly presents users with a binary query, whether to purchase or skip a recommended product [35]. Since most users skip products most of the time [33], the probability of skipping becomes nearly 1 for most items. This lack of variation in choices makes it difficult to assess how much a user likes or dislikes any specific product, limiting the system’s ability to accurately infer their preferences. Response time can help overcome this limitation. Psychological research shows an inverse relationship between response time and preference strength [17]: users who strongly prefer to skip a product tend to do so quickly, while longer response times can indicate weaker preferences. Thus, even when choices appear similar, response time can uncover subtle differences in preference strength, helping to accelerate preference learning.\n\nLeveraging response times for preference learning presents notable challenges. Psychological research has extensively studied the relationship between human choices and response times [17, 19] using complex models like Drift-Diffusion Models [51] and Race Models [66, 12]. While these models align with both behavioral and neurobiological evidence [70], they rely on computationally intensive methods, such as hierarchical Bayesian inference [71] and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) [52], to estimate the underlying human utility functions from both human choices and response times, making them impractical for real-time interactive systems. Although faster estimators exist [67, 68, 30, 28, 8], they typically estimate the utility functions for a single pair of options without aggregating data across multiple pairs. This limits their ability to leverage structures like linear utility functions, which are widely adopted both in preference learning with large option spaces [41, 54, 24, 56, 21] and in cognitive models for human multi-attribute decision-making [64, 26, 76].\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient method for estimating linear human utility functions from both choices and response times, grounded in the difference-based EZ diffusion model [67, 8]. Our method leverages response times to transform binary choices into richer continuous signals, framing utility estimation as a linear regression problem that aggregates data across multiple pairs of options. We compare our estimator to traditional logistic regression methods that rely solely on choices [3, 31]. For queries with strong preferences, our theoretical and empirical analyses show that response times complement choices by providing additional information about preference strength. This significantly improves utility estimation compared to using choices alone. For queries with weak preferences, response times add little value but do not degrade performance. In summary, response times complement choices, particularly for queries with strong preferences.\n\nOur linear-regression-based estimator integrates seamlessly into algorithms for preference-based bandits with linear human utility functions [3, 31], enabling interactive learning systems to leverage response times for faster learning. We specifically integrated our estimator into the Generalized Successive Elimination algorithm [3] for fixed-budget best-arm identification [29, 34]. Simulations using three real-world datasets [57, 16, 39] consistently show that incorporating response times significantly reduces identification errors, compared to traditional methods that rely solely on choices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate response times into bandits (and RL).\n\nSection 2 introduces the preference-based linear bandit problem and the difference-based EZ diffusion model. Section 3 presents our utility estimator, incorporating both choices and response times, and offers a theoretical comparison to the choice-only estimator. Section 4 integrates both estimators into the Generalized Successive Elimination algorithm. Section 5 presents empirical results for estimation and bandit learning. Section 6 discusses the limitations of our approach. Appendix B reviews response time models, parameter estimation techniques, and their connection to preference-based RL.",

        "title": "Rho-1: Not All Tokens Are What You Need",
        "introduction": "Scaling up model parameters and dataset size has consistently elevated the next-token prediction accuracy in large language models, yielding significant advancements in artificial intelligence (Kaplan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023; Team et al., 2023). However, training on all available data is not always optimal or feasible. As a result, the practice of data filtering has become crucial, using various heuristics and classifiers (Brown et al., 2020; Wenzek et al., 2019) to select training documents. These techniques significantly improve data quality and boost model performance.\n\nHowever, despite thorough document-level filtering, high-quality datasets still contain many noisy tokens that can negatively affect training, as illustrated in Figure 2 (Upper). Removing such tokens might alter the text’s meaning, while overly strict filtering could exclude useful data (Welbl et al., 2021; Muennighoff et al., 2024) and lead to biases (Dodge et al., 2021; Longpre et al., 2023). Furthermore, research indicates that the distribution of web data does not inherently align with the ideal distribution for downstream applications (Tay et al., 2022; Wettig et al., 2023). For example, common corpus at the token level may include undesirable content like hallucinations or highly ambiguous tokens that are hard to predict. Applying the same loss to all tokens can lead to inefficient computation on non-essential tokens, potentially restricting LLMs from achieving more advanced levels of intelligence.\n\nTo explore how language models learn at the token level, we initially examined training dynamics, particularly how the token-level loss evolves during usual pretraining. In §2.1, we evaluated the model’s token perplexity at different checkpoints and categorized tokens into different types. Our findings reveal that significant loss reduction is limited to a select group of tokens. Many tokens are “easy tokens” that are already learned, and some are “hard tokens” that exhibit variable losses and resist convergence. These tokens can lead to numerous ineffective gradient updates.\n\nBased on these analyses, we introduce Rho-1 models trained with a novel Selective Language Modeling (SLM) objective 1. As shown in Figure 2 (Right), this approach inputs the full sequence into the model and selectively removes the loss of undesired tokens. The detailed pipeline is depicted in Figure 4: First, SLM trains a reference language model on high-quality corpora. This model establishes utility metrics to score tokens according to the desired distribution, naturally filtering out unclean and irrelevant tokens. Second, SLM uses the reference model to score each token in a corpus using its loss (§2.2). Finally, we train a language model only on those tokens that exhibit a high excess loss between the reference and the training model, selectively learning the tokens that best benefit downstream applications (§2.2).\n\nWe show through comprehensive experiments that SLM significantly enhances token efficiency during training and improves performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that SLM effectively identifies tokens relevant to the target distribution, resulting in improved perplexity scores on benchmarks for models trained with the selected tokens. §3.2 shows the effectiveness of SLM on math continual pretraining: both 1B and 7B Rho-1 outperform CLM-trained baselines by over 16% on the GSM8k and MATH datasets. SLM reaches baseline accuracy up to 10x faster, as shown in Figure 1. Remarkably, Rho-1-7B matches the state-of-the-art performance of DeepSeekMath-7B using only 15B tokens, compared to the 500B tokens required by DeepSeekMath. Upon fine-tuning, Rho-1-1B and 7B achieve 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH, respectively. Notably, Rho-1-1B is the first 1B LM to exceed 40% accuracy, nearing the early GPT-4’s CoT performance of 42.5%. §3.3 confirms the efficacy of SLM in general continual pretraining: Training Tinyllama-1B on 80B tokens with SLM improves 6.8% on average across 15 benchmarks, with gains over 10% in code and math tasks. In §3.4, we demonstrate that in settings without high-quality reference data, we can use SLM for self-referencing, leading to an average improvement of up to 3.3% in downstream tasks.",

        "title": "Learning Action and Reasoning-Centric Image Editing from Videos and Simulations",
        "introduction": "Image editing is a complex task, involving many different skills, from adding/removing objects, changing colors/textures/styles, to “taking actions”: moving objects, changing actor positions or even more complex interactions. Tackling all of these requires fine-grained understanding of how visual scenes are composed as well as reasoning (e.g. spatial instructions or referring expressions). No current model can successfully do all of these edits, and most only perform localized changes involving object addition/removal or attribute edits, following the “inpainting paradigm” [Zhang et al., 2024, Xie et al., 2023]. Others have tried to address this issue by introducing more specialized model architectures which handle different editing subtasks [Couairon et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023a]. However, neither of these approaches includes edits requiring more holistic visual understanding of how humans and objects interact or how events unfold, such as ‘make the cook cut the apple in half’ or ‘make the dog jump in the air’ (see Fig. 1). These more action-centric edits are severely understudied in the space of instruction-tuned image editing models [Brooks et al., 2023, Huang et al., 2024]; when they are considered, it is done in isolation, ignoring other image edit subtasks and rigorous semantic evaluation [Soucek et al., 2023, Black et al., 2024]. In Sec. 2 we ˇdescribe a typology of these edit types and how existing datasets currently fail to address them all.\n        \n        As we argue in this paper, a major reason for these limitations is the lack of high-quality data. Finetuning data of object or attribute changes is simpler to acquire than other forms of edits, since inpainting setups directly leverage strong object and attribute abilities of txt2img models [Rombach et al., 2022] for paired-image data generation [Yildirim et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2024]. However, solving the data scarcity for learning action and reasoning-centric edits is not as straightforward. We identify videos and simulation engines as the two most promising sources of data for these edit types. As we discuss in this paper, we find that previous models trained on “noisy” synthetic image pairs or video frames lead to poor editing abilities. Here, noisy refers to image pairs with changes not mentioned in the prompt, i.e. due to shortcomings of the automatic generation process or inherent properties of videos such as viewpoint changes and non-meaningful movement. Therefore, our main requirement of high-quality action and reasoning-centric edit examples is that they be truly minimal: Edited images which contain one or maximally two semantic changes described by the prompt, while all other aspects are kept exactly the same. From a diverse set of video sources and simulation engines, we curate the AURORA Dataset (Action-Reasoning-Object-Attribute). Via crowd-sourcing and curation we collect 130K truly-minimal examples from videos and 150K from simulation engines for instruction-tuned image editing. We describe our dataset and collection process in Sec. 3.\n        \n        The few image-text-alignment metrics commonly used in image editing are based on visual similarity to a groundtruth and in reality turn out to mostly measure the ability to stay maximally faithful (i.e. copying) to the source image [Zhang et al., 2024, Fu et al., 2023]. Though faithfulness is an important first step to master, these metrics have almost no correlation with the model’s ability to generate accurate edits, especially on action and reasoning-centric changes. Hence, in addition to the training data in AURORA, we introduce AURORA-BENCH(Sec. 4), a manually annotated benchmark covering 8 editing tasks on which we collect human judgement (Tab. 2). Inspired by work on image generation models as discriminators [Krojer et al., 2023, Li et al., 2023], we also describe a novel discriminative metric that assesses understanding and hallucination (Sec. 5.1). To demonstrate the efficacy and quality of AURORA, we present a state-of-the-art instruction-tuned image editing model, finetuned on AURORA and evaluated on AURORA-BENCH, which we compare to strong baselines in a set of experiments in Sec. 5.3.\n        \n        In summary our contributions are: 1) The creation of AURORA, a new clean and varied set of image edit pairs for instruction-finetuning that encompasses more action-centric and reasoningcentric examples. 2) We present a comprehensive benchmark covering a variety of edit types; 3) We introduce a novel more informative metric beyond existing ones; 4) We provide a state-of-the-art image editing model based on AURORA with well-rounded image editing capabilities covering object-centric, action-centric, and reasoning-centric edit abilities.",

        "title": "The Value of Reward Lookahead in Reinforcement Learning",
        "introduction": "Reinforcement Learning (RL, Sutton and Barto, 2018) is the problem of learning how to interact with a changing environment. The setting usually consists of two major elements: a transition kernel, which governs how the state of the environment evolves due to the actions of an agent, and a reward given to the agent for performing an action at a given environment state. Agents must decide which actions to perform in order to collect as much reward as possible, taking into account not only the immediate reward gain, but also the long-term effects of actions on the state dynamics.\n\nIn the standard RL framework, reward information is usually observed after playing an action, and agents only aim to maximize their cumulative expected reward, also known as the value (Jaksch et al., 2010; Azar et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018; Dann et al., 2019; Zanette and Brunskill, 2019; Efroni et al., 2019b; Simchowitz and Jamieson, 2019; Zhang et al., 2021b). Yet, in many real-world scenarios, partial information about the future reward is accessible in advance. For example, when performing transactions, prices are usually known. In navigation settings, rewards are sometimes associated with traffic, which can be accurately estimated for the near future. In goal-oriented problems (Schaul et al., 2015; Andrychowicz et al., 2017), the location of the goal is oftentimes revealed in advance. This information is completely ignored by agents that maximize the expected reward, even though using this future information on the reward should greatly increase the reward collected by the agent.\n\nAs an illustration, consider a driving problem where an agent travels between two locations, aiming to collect as much reward as possible. In one such scenario, rewards are given only when traveling free roads. It would then be reasonable to assume that agents see whether there is traffic before deciding in which way to turn at every intersection (‘one-step lookahead’). In an alternative scenario, the agent participates in ride-sharing and gains a reward when picking up a passenger. In this case, agents gain information on nearby passengers along the path, not necessarily just in the closest intersection (‘multi-step lookahead’). Finally, the destination might be revealed only at the beginning of the interaction, and reward is only gained when reaching it (‘full lookahead’). In all examples, the additional information should be utilized by the agent to increase its collected reward.\n\nIn this paper, we analyze the value of future (lookahead) information on the reward that could be obtained by the agent through the lens of competitive analysis. More precisely, we study the competitive ratio (CR) between the value of an agent that only has access to reward distributions and that of a lookahead agent who sees the actual reward realizations for several future timesteps before choosing each action. Our contributions are the following: (i) Given an environment and its expected rewards, we characterize the distribution that maximizes the value of lookahead agents, for all ranges of lookahead from one step to full lookahead; this distribution therefore minimizes the CR. In particular, we show that the lookahead value is maximized by long-shot rewards – very high rewards at extremely low probabilities. (ii) We derive the worst-case CR as a function of the dynamics of the environment (that is, for the worst-case reward expectations). Surprisingly, the CR that emerges is closely related to fundamental quantities in reward-free exploration and offline RL (Xie et al., 2022; Al-Marjani et al., 2023). (iii) We analyze the CR for the worst-possible environment. Specifically, tree-like environments that require deciding both when and where to navigate exhibit near-worst-case CR. (iv) Lastly, we complement these results by presenting different environments and their CR, providing more intuition to our results.",

        "title": "Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons",
        "introduction": "Before the advent of modern deep learning architectures, artificial neural networks were inspired by biological neurons. In contrast to the McCulloch-Pitts neuron (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943) which was designed as an abstraction of an integrate-and-fire neuron (Sherrington, 1906), recent building blocks of neural networks are designed to work well on modern hardware (Hooker, 2021). As our understanding of the brain is improving over recent years, and neuroscientists are discovering more about its information processing principles, we can ask ourselves again if there are lessons from neuroscience that can be used as design principles for artificial neural nets.\n\nIn this paper, we follow a more modern dynamical view of neurons as oscillatory units that are coupled to other neurons (Muller et al., 2018). Similar to how the binary state of a McCulloch-Pitts neuron abstracts the firing of a real neuron, we will abstract an oscillating neuron by an \nN\n-dimensional unit vector that rotates on the sphere (Löwe et al., 2023). We build a new neural network architecture that has iterative modules that update \nN\n-dimensional oscillatory neurons via a generalization of the well-known non-linear dynamical model called the Kuramoto model (Kuramoto, 1984).\n\nThe Kuramoto model describes the synchronization of oscillators; each Kuramoto update applies forces to connected oscillators, encouraging them to become aligned or anti-aligned. This process is similar to binding in neuroscience and can be understood as distributed and continuous clustering. Thus, networks with this mechanism tend to compress their representations via synchronization.\n\nWe incorporate the Kuramoto model into an artificial neural network, by applying the differential equation that describes the Kuramoto model to each individual neuron. The resulting artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons (AKOrN) can be combined with layer architectures such as fully connected layers, convolutions, and attention mechanisms.\n\nWe explore the capabilities of AKOrN and find that its neuronal mechanism drastically changes the behavior of the network. AKOrN strongly binds object features with competitive performance to slot-based models in object discovery, enhances the reasoning capability of self-attention, and increases robustness against random, adversarial, and natural perturbations with surprisingly good calibration.",

        "title": "Exploring the loss landscape of regularized neural networks via convex duality",
        "introduction": "Despite the nonconvex nature of neural networks, training them with local gradient methods finds nearly optimal parameters. Understanding the properties of the loss landscape is theoretically important, as it enables us to depict the learning dynamics of neural networks. For instance, many existing works prove that the loss landscape is “benign” in some sense - i.e. they don’t have spurious local minima, bad valleys, or decreasing path to infinity Kawaguchi (2016), Venturi et al. (2019), Haeffele & Vidal (2017), Sun et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2021b), Liang et al. (2022). Such characterization enlightens our intuition on why these networks are trained so well.\n\nAs part of understanding the loss landscape, understanding the structure of global optimum has gained much interest. An example is mode connectivity Garipov et al. (2018), where a simple curve connects two global optima in the set of optimal parameters. Another example is analyzing the permutation symmetry that a global optimum has Simsek et al. (2021). Mathematically understanding the global optimum is important as it sheds light on the structure of the loss landscape. They can also motivate practical algorithms that search over neural networks with the same optimal cost Ainsworth et al. (2022), Mishkin & Pilanci (2023), having practical motivations to study. \n\nWe shape the loss landscape of regularized neural networks with ReLU activation, mainly analyzing mathematical properties of the global optimum, by considering its convex counterpart and leveraging the dual problem. Our work is inspired by the work of Mishkin & Pilanci (2023), where they characterize the optimal set and stationary points of a two-layer neural network with weight decay using the convex counterpart. They also introduce several important concepts such as the polytope characterization of the optimal solution set, minimal solutions, pruning a solution, and the optimal model fit. Expanding the idea of Mishkin & Pilanci (2023), we show a clear connection between the polytope characterization and the dual optimum. We further derive novel characters of the optimal set of neural networks, the loss landscape, and generalize the result to different architectures.\n\nFinally, it is worth pointing out that regularization plays a central role in modern machine learning, including the training of large language models Andriushchenko et al. (2023). Therefore, including regularization better reflects the training procedure in practice.\n\nMore importantly, adding regularization can change the qualitative behavior of the loss landscape and the global optimum Wang et al. (2021b): for example, there always exist infinitely many optimal solutions for the unregularized problem with ReLU activation due to positive homogeneity. However, regularizing the parameter weights breaks this tie and we may not have infinitely many optimal solutions. It is also possible to design the regularization for the loss landscape to satisfy certain properties such as no spurious local minima Liang et al. (2022), Ge et al. (2017) or unique global optimum Mishkin & Pilanci (2023), Boursier & Flammarion (2023). Understanding the loss landscape of regularized neural networks is not only a more realistic setup but can also give novel theoretical properties that the unregularized problem does not have.\n\nThe specific findings we have for regularized neural networks are:\n\n• The optimal polytope: We revisit the fact that the regularized neural network’s convex reformulation has a polytope as an optimal set Mishkin & Pilanci (2023). We give a connection between the dual optimum and the polytope.\n\n• The staircase of connectivity: For two-layer neural networks with scalar output, we give critical widths and phase transitional behavior of the optimal set as the width of the network m changes. See Figure 1 for an abstract depiction of this phenomenon.\n\n• Nonunique minimum-norm interpolators: We examine the problem in Boursier & Flammarion (2023) and show that free skip connections (i.e., an unregularized linear neuron), bias in the training problem, and unidimensional data are all necessary to guarantee the uniqueness of the minimumnorm interpolator. We construct explicit examples where the solution is not unique in each case, inspired by the dual problem. In contrast to the previous perspectives Boursier & Flammarion (2023), Joshi et al. (2023), our results imply that free skip connections may change the qualitative behavior of optimal solutions. Moreover, uniqueness does not hold in dimensions greater than one.\n\n• Generalizations: We extend our results by providing a general description of solution sets of the cone-constrained group LASSO. The extensions include the existence of fixed first-layer weight directions for parallel deep neural networks, and connectivity of optimal sets for vector-valued neural networks with regularization.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: after discussing related work (Section 1.1) and notations (Section 1.2), we discuss the convex reformulation of neural networks as a preliminary in Section 2. Then we discuss the case of two-layer neural networks with scalar output in Section 3, starting from the optimal polytope characterization (Section 3.1), the staircase of connectivity (Section 3.2), and construction of non-unique minimum-norm interpolators (Section 3.3). The possible generalizations are introduced in Section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5. Detailed explanations of the experiments and proofs are deferred to the appendix.",

        "introduction": "Foundation models have revolutionized our world, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in solving grade school math problems, writing creative essays, generating stunning images, and comprehending visual content (openai2023gpt4; ChatGPT; ramesh2022hierarchical). One notable example is CLIP (radford2021learning), a vision-language model pretrained on a vast dataset of image-text pairs, which forms the backbone of numerous other foundation models (ramesh2022hierarchical; liu2023visualinstructiontuning). CLIP has achieved unprecedented performance across a wide range of benchmarks spanning many domains—a sharp contrast to models from the ImageNet era, which struggled to generalize from a training domain mostly consisting of natural photographs to stylistically different domains such as ImageNet-Sketch (wang2019learning), ImageNet-R (hendrycks2020many), and DomainNet (peng2019moment).\n\nDomains, while often challenging to quantify in practice (bendavid), emerge from collecting data from specific sources and conditions. Some domains, like natural images or renditions, are better delineated, allowing the creation of datasets like the ones mentioned above. Out-of-domain (OOD) generalization refers to a model’s ability to perform well on data from domains other than its training domain(s) (wang2022generalizingunseendomainssurvey). In this work, we collectively refer to the domain represented by ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-R, DomainNet-Painting, DomainNet-Clipart, DomainNet-Sketch, and DomainNet-Quickdraw as the rendition domain, since it contains images that are renditions of natural objects and scenes. Generalization to the rendition domain (especially OOD) is crucial for aligning models with human perception, as humans can interpret abstract visual renditions, while machines tend to rely heavily on textural cues (hendrycks2020many; geirhos2018imagenet).\n\nCLIP’s strong performance in several domains, including renditions, is attributed to its vast training distribution, rather than its contrastive learning objective, language supervision, or dataset size (fang2022data). However, fang2022data do not specify what characteristics of the training distribution drive this performance. CLIP could be learning more robust representations due to the diversity of natural images in its training set—or it may simply have been exposed to many datapoints from the (assumed to be OOD) test domains during training. Indeed, mayilvahanan2024 revealed that CLIP’s training data contains exact or near duplicates of samples of many OOD datasets. Yet, they showed that CLIP still generalizes well when this sample contamination is corrected. However, their analysis failed to account for domain contamination.\n\nIn contrast to sample contamination, domain contamination does not focus on duplicates of specific datapoints but rather examines whether critical aspects of a test domain are present in the training domain, such as images with different content but similar style to test samples. For example, after the correction by mayilvahanan2024, many other rendition images, while not duplicates, remained in CLIP’s training set (refer to Tab. LABEL:tab:domain_composition). Prior works often assume that CLIP is capable of generalizing OOD (radford2021learning; abbasi2024decipheringrolerepresentationdisentanglement; nguyen2024saftoutofdistributiongeneralizationfinetuning; fang2022data; li2023distillinglargevisionlanguagemodel; shu2023clipoodgeneralizingclipoutofdistributions); however, it remains unclear whether this is truly the case or if its performance is primarily driven by training on images from the test domain. This leads us to our central question:\n\nTo what extent does domain contamination explain CLIP’s performance on renditions?\n\nWe address the central question with the following contributions:\n\n• Constructing Clean Single-Domain Datasets: To rigorously test whether CLIP’s success in the rendition domain stems from their exposure during training, we first train a domain classifier to distinguish natural images from renditions (Sec. 3.2). By applying the domain classifier to a deduplicated version of LAION-400M, we create and release two datasets: LAION-Natural contains 57M natural images; LAION-Rendition consists of 16M renditions of scenes and objects. Additionally, we refine existing rendition OOD benchmarks (ImageNet-R, ImageNet-Sketch, etc.) by removing samples that do not belong to the corresponding domain (LABEL:sec:subsampling_datasets).\n\n• Refining the Evaluation of CLIP’s OOD Performance: Using LAION-Natural, we demonstrate that CLIP trained only on natural images significantly underperforms on rendition domain shifts (LABEL:sec:laion_nat_v_random). This suggests that its original success stems from domain contamination, not from an intrinsic OOD generalization ability (see Fig. 1 for a summary).\n\n• Investigating Domain Mixing and Scaling Effects: Our single-domain datasets enable analyzing the effects of training on controlled mixtures of natural and rendition images across scales (LABEL:sec:laion_mix). We identify the optimal mixing ratio for the best overall performance and show the degree to which training on one domain enables some generalization to the other.\n\nThrough this work, we aim to shed light on the limitations of foundation models like CLIP in handling OOD generalization and provide valuable datasets and tools to the community for further exploration. Fig. 1 illustrates our core methodology.",

        "title": "Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering",
        "introduction": "A striking feature of large language models (LLMs) is their ability to process high-level concepts through rich representations in their activations. This feature has given rise to techniques like activation steering (Turner et al., 2023), which leverage these learned representations to efficiently and predictably alter LLM behavior (Wang et al., 2024b; Zou et al., 2023; Rimsky et al., 2024).\n\nProblem: Lack of conditional control in activation steering. Activation steering offers a promising alternative to optimization-based techniques by directly manipulating the model’s native representations, often requiring only a simple activation addition step during each forward call (Turner et al., 2023). While activation steering has shown promise in altering LLM behavior, such as removing or inducing refusal behavior, a key limitation of current methods is the inability to condition when and what to refuse (Zheng et al., 2024; Ghandeharioun et al., 2024). That is, adding a “refusal vector” using existing activation steering methods increases refusal rates indiscriminately across all inputs, limiting the model’s utility (Arditi et al., 2024).\n\nContribution: Adding “control” to activation steering. We introduce Conditional Activation Steering (CAST), a method that enables fine-grained, context-dependent control over LLM behaviors. We introduce a new type of steering vector in the activation steering formulation, the condition vector, representing certain activation patterns induced by the prompt during the inference process. A simple similarity calculation between this condition vector and the model’s activation at inference time effectively serves as a switch, determining whether to apply the refusal vector. This approach allows for selective refusal of harmful prompts while maintaining the ability to respond to harmless ones, as depicted in Figure 1. A breakdown of this figure is presented in Table 3. Furthermore, CAST maintains the data, runtime, and compute efficiency of activation steering (Figure 6) while adding controllability, enabling the implementation of behavioral rules in LLMs without significant costs.\n\nApplication: Selecting what to refuse.   Many alignment goals concern contextually refusing specific classes of instructions (Anwar et al., 2024). Traditional methods like preference modeling are resource-intensive and struggle with subjective, black-box rewards (Feng et al., 2024; Pitis, 2023; Rafailov et al., 2024; Stiennon et al., 2020; Hayum et al.,). Additionally, the definition of harmful content varies across contexts (He et al., 2024b; Sorensen et al., 2024; Santurkar et al., 2023), complicating the creation of universal harm models. The usage context further complicates this variability; for instance, discussing medical advice might be harmful in some situations (Wang et al., 2023b) but essential in others, such as in medical chatbots (Xie et al., 2024a). In this paper, we show CAST can implement behavioral rules like “if input is about hate speech or adult content, then refuse” (Figure 8a) or “if input is not about legal advice, then refuse” (Figure 9a), allowing for selective modification of responses to specific content without weight optimization.\n\nOn a technical level, our primary insight is that different prompts consistently activate distinct patterns in the model’s hidden states during inference (Hu et al., 2024). These patterns can be extracted as a steering vector and used as reference points for detecting specific prompt categories or contexts. This observation allows us to use steering vectors not only as behavior modification mechanisms but also as condition indicators, which we term “condition vectors.” Our specific contributions are as follows:\n\n1) Framework: We introduce conditional activation steering and condition vectors, which adds a new dimension of controllability to existing methods.\n\n2) Application: We demonstrate the logical composition of condition vectors to create custom refusal conditions. This is a key step towards tailoring model behavior to specific needs.\n\n3) Codebase: We release a general-purpose activation steering toolkit with demo datasets for the broader activation engineering community <placeholder: open-source GitHub link>.",

        "title": "Efficient and Accurate Explanation Estimation with Distribution Compression",
        "introduction": "Computationally efficient estimation of post-hoc explanations is at the forefront of current research on explainable machine learning (Strumbelj & Kononenko, 2010; Slack et al., 2021; Jethani et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Donnelly et al., 2023; Muschalik et al., 2024). The majority of the work focuses on improving efficiency with respect to the dimension of features (Covert et al., 2020; Jethani et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Fumagalli et al., 2023), specific model classes like neural networks (Erion et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2024) and decision trees (Muschalik et al., 2024), or approximating the conditional feature distribution (Chen et al., 2018; Aas et al., 2021; Olsen et al., 2022; 2024).\n\nHowever, in many practical settings, a marginal feature distribution is used instead to estimate explanations, and i.i.d. samples from the data typically form the so-called background data samples, also known as reference points or baselines, which plays a crucial role in the estimation process (Lundberg & Lee, 2017; Scholbeck et al., 2020; Erion et al., 2021; Ghalebikesabi et al., 2021; Lundstrom et al., 2022). For example, Covert et al. (2020) mention “[O]ur sampling approximation for SAGE was run using draws from the marginal distribution. We used a fixed set of 512 background samples […]” and we provide more such references in Appendix A to motivate our research question: Can we reliably improve on standard i.i.d. sampling in explanation estimation?\n\nWe make a connection to research on statistical theory, where kernel thinning (kt, Dwivedi & Mackey, 2021; 2022) was introduced to compress a distribution more effectively than with i.i.d. sampling. kt has an efficient implementation in the compress++ algorithm (Shetty et al., 2022) and was applied to improve statistical kernel testing (Domingo-Enrich et al., 2023). Building on this line of work, this paper aims to thoroughly quantify the error introduced by the current sample then explain paradigm in feature marginalization, which is involved in the estimation of both local and global removal-based explanations (Covert et al., 2021). We propose an efficient way to reduce this approximation error based on distribution compression (Figure 1).\n\nContribution. In summary, our work advances literature in multiple ways: (1) Quantifying the error of standard i.i.d. sampling: We bring to attention and measure the approximation error introduced by using i.i.d. sampling of background and foreground data in various explanation methods. It may even lead to changes in feature importance rankings. (2) Compress then explain (cte): We introduce a new paradigm of sample-efficient explainability where post-hoc explanations, like feature attributions and effects, are estimated based on a marginal distribution compressed more efficiently than with i.i.d. sampling. cte is theoretically justified as we discover a connection between explanation estimation and distribution compression. (3) Kernel thinning for (explainable) machine learning: We show empirically that kt outperforms i.i.d. sampling in compressing the distribution of popular datasets used in research on explainable machine learning. In fact, this is the first work to evaluate distribution compression via kt on datasets for supervised learning, which itself is valuable. (4) Decreasing the computational cost of explanation estimation: We benchmark compress then explain (cte) with popular explanation methods and show it results in more accurate explanations of smaller variance. cte often achieves on-par error using 2–3× fewer samples, i.e. requiring 2–3× fewer model inferences. cte is a simple, yet powerful, plug-in for a broad class of methods that sample from a dataset, e.g. removal-based and global explanations.",
