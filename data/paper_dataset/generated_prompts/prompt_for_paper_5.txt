Question Type: "What is the core problem the authors aim to solve?", "What research gap does this paper intend to fill?", "What is the main advantage of the proposed method?", "Summarize the key contribution of this work in relation to prior limitations."

Desired JSON Output Format:
The final output MUST be a JSON array containing 30 objects. Each object must have three keys: level (integer: 1, 2, or 3), question (string), and answer (string).

Example:

[
  {
    "level": 1,
    "question": "What is the full name of the algorithm the authors integrate their estimator into?",
    "answer": "The authors integrated their estimator into the Generalized Successive Elimination algorithm."
  },
  {
    "level": 2,
    "question": "According to the text, what is the inverse relationship between response time and preference strength?",
    "answer": "The text states that users who strongly prefer to skip a product tend to do so quickly, while longer response times can indicate weaker preferences."
  },
  {
    "level": 3,
    "question": "What is the core reason complex psychological models are impractical for real-time systems, and how does this paper's proposal address it?",
    "answer": "They are impractical because they rely on computationally intensive methods like hierarchical Bayesian inference and MLE. This paper addresses it by proposing a computationally efficient method that frames utility estimation as a linear regression problem."

Title: Human Expertise in Algorithmic Prediction

Despite remarkable advances in machine learning, human judgment continues to play a critical role in many high-stakes prediction tasks. For example, consider the problem of triage in the emergency room, where healthcare providers assess and prioritize patients for immediate care. On one hand, prognostic algorithms offer significant promise for improving triage decisions; indeed, algorithmic predictions are often more accurate than even expert human decision makers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. On the other hand, predictive algorithms may fail to fully capture the relevant context for each individual. For example, an algorithmic risk score may only have access to tabular electronic health records or other structured data (e.g., medical imaging), while a physician has access to many additional modalities—not least of which is the ability to directly examine the patient!

These two observations—that algorithms often outperform humans, but humans often have access to a richer information set—are not in conflict with each other. Indeed, [9] find exactly this phenomenon in an analysis of emergency room triage decisions. This suggests that, even in settings where algorithms outperform humans, algorithms might still benefit from some form of human input. Ideally this collaboration will yield human-AI complementarity [10, 11], in which a joint system outperforms either a human or algorithm working alone. Our work thus begins with the following question:

When (and how) can human judgment improve the predictions of any learning algorithm?

Example: X-ray classification. Consider the problem of diagnosing atelectasis (a partially or fully collapsed lung; we study this task in detail in Section 5). Today’s state-of-the-art deep learning models can perform well on these kinds of classification tasks using only a patient’s chest X-ray as input [12, 13, 14]. We are interested in whether we can further improve these algorithmic predictions by incorporating a “second opinion” from a physician, particularly because the physician may have access to information (e.g., by directly observing the patient) which is not present in the X-ray.

A first heuristic, without making any assumptions about the available predictive models, is to ask whether a physician can distinguish patients whose imaging data are identical. For example, if a physician can correctly indicate that one patient is suffering from atelectasis while another is not—despite the patients having identical chest X-rays—the physician must have information that the X-ray does not capture. In principle, this could form the basis for a statistical test: we could ask whether the physician performs better than random in distinguishing a large number of such patients. If so, even a predictive algorithm which outperforms the physician might benefit from human input.

Of course, we are unlikely to find identical observations in continuous-valued and/or high-dimensional data (like X-rays). A natural relaxation is to instead consider observations which are sufficiently “similar”, as suggested by [9]. In this work we propose a more general notion of algorithmic indistinguishability, or coarser subsets of inputs in which no algorithm (in some rich, user-defined class) has significant predictive power. We show that these subsets can be discovered via a novel connection to multicalibration [15], and formally demonstrate that using human feedback to predict outcomes within these subsets can outperform any algorithmic predictor (in the same user-defined class). In addition to being tractable, this framework is relevant from a decision-theoretic perspective: although we’ve focused thus far on algorithms’ fundamental informational constraints, it is also natural to ask whether an expert provides signal which is merely difficult for an algorithm to learn directly (due to e.g., limited training data or computational constraints). Our approach naturally interpolates between these contexts by defining indistinguishability with respect to whichever class of models is practically relevant for a given prediction task. We elaborate on these contributions below.

Contributions. We propose a novel framework for human-AI collaboration in prediction tasks. Our approach uses human feedback to refine predictions within sets of inputs which are algorithmically indistinguishable, or “look the same” to predictive algorithms. In Section 4 we present a simple method to incorporate this feedback only when it improves on the best feasible predictive model (and precisely quantify this improvement). This extends the “omnipredictors” result of [16] in the special case of squared error, which may be of independent interest.1 In Section 5 we present experiments demonstrating that although humans fail to outperform algorithmic predictors on average, there exist specific (algorithmically indistinguishable) instances on which humans are more accurate than the best available predictor (and these instances are identifiable ex ante).2 In Section 6 we consider the complementary setting in which an algorithm provides recommendations to many downstream users, who independently choose when to comply. We provide conditions under which a predictor is robust to these compliance patterns, and thus be simultaneously optimal for all downstream users.
