  },
  {
    "level": 2,
    "question": "According to the text, what is the inverse relationship between response time and preference strength?",
    "answer": "The text states that users who strongly prefer to skip a product tend to do so quickly, while longer response times can indicate weaker preferences."

  {
    "level": 3,
    "question": "What is the core reason complex psychological models are impractical for real-time systems, and how does this paper's proposal address it?",
    "answer": "They are impractical because they rely on computationally intensive methods like hierarchical Bayesian inference and MLE. This paper addresses it by proposing a computationally efficient method that frames utility estimation as a linear regression problem."

Title: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for System 2 Planning

Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach to planning, enabling the generation of complex trajectories by modeling trajectory distributions using large-scale offline data (Janner et al., 2022; Ajay et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a, c, b). Unlike traditional autoregressive planning methods, diffusion-based planners, such as Diffuser (Janner et al., 2022), generate entire trajectories holistically through a series of denoising steps, eliminating the need for a forward dynamics model. This approach effectively addresses key limitations of forward models, such as poor long-term dependency modeling and error accumulation (Hafner et al., 2022; Hamed et al., 2024), making it particularly well-suited for planning tasks with long horizons or sparse rewards.

Despite their strengths, it remains uncertain how diffusion-based planners can effectively enhance planning accuracy through the computation scaling on the inference time—a property referred to as inference-time scalability. One potential approach is to increase the number of denoising steps or, alternatively, draw additional samples (Zhou et al., 2024). However, it is known that performance gains from increasing denoising steps plateau quickly (Karras et al., 2022; Song et al., 2021a, b), and independent random searches with multiple samples are highly inefficient as they fail to leverage information from other samples. Moreover, how to effectively manage the exploration-exploitation tradeoff within this framework also remains unclear.

In contrast, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Coulom, 2007), a widely adopted planning method, demonstrates robust inference-time scalability. By leveraging iterative simulations, MCTS refines decisions and adapts based on exploratory feedback, making it highly effective in improving planning accuracy as more computation is allocated. This capability has established MCTS as a cornerstone in many System 2 reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving (Guan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024a) and program synthesis (Brandfonbrener et al., 2024). However, unlike diffusion-based planners, traditional MCTS relies on a forward model for tree rollouts, inheriting its limitations including losing global consistency. In addition to being restricted to discrete action spaces, the resulting search tree can grow excessively large in both depth and width. This leads to significant computational demands, particularly in scenarios involving long horizons and large action spaces.

This raises a crucial question: how can we combine the strengths of Diffuser and MCTS to overcome their limitations and enhance the inference-time scalability of diffusion-based planning? To address this, we propose Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a framework that integrates diffusion-based trajectory generation with the iterative search capabilities of MCTS for more efficient and scalable planning.

MCTD builds on three key innovations. First, it restructures denoising into a tree-based rollout process, enabling semi-autoregressive causal planning while maintaining trajectory coherence. Second, it introduces guidance levels as meta-actions to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring adaptive and scalable trajectory refinement within the diffusion framework. Third, it employs fast jumpy denoising as a simulation mechanism, efficiently estimating trajectory quality without costly forward model rollouts. These innovations enable the four steps of MCTS (Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation) within diffusion planning, effectively bridging structured search with generative modeling. Experimental results show that MCTD outperforms existing approaches in long-horizon tasks, achieving superior scalability and solution quality.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an MCTS-integrated diffusion planning framework that explicitly incorporates the four steps of MCTS, providing an effective inference-time scaling method for diffusion models. Second, we introduce three key innovations: Denoising as Tree-Rollout, Guidance Levels as Meta-Actions, and Jumpy Denoising as Fast Simulation. Lastly, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of MCTD.
