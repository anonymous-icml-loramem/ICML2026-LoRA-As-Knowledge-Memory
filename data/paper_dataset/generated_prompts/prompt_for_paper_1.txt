  {
    "level": 2,
    "question": "According to the text, what is the inverse relationship between response time and preference strength?",
    "answer": "The text states that users who strongly prefer to skip a product tend to do so quickly, while longer response times can indicate weaker preferences."

  {
    "level": 3,
    "question": "What is the core reason complex psychological models are impractical for real-time systems, and how does this paper's proposal address it?",
    "answer": "They are impractical because they rely on computationally intensive methods like hierarchical Bayesian inference and MLE. This paper addresses it by proposing a computationally efficient method that frames utility estimation as a linear regression problem."

Title: An Analysis for Reasoning Bias of Language Models with Small Initialization

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of tasks, from text generation to complex reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a; Achiam et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024). Reasoning, in particular, is a critical ability for LLMs. A number of studies have focused on improving the reasoning ability of these models through data-driven approaches, such as RHO-1 (Lin et al., 2024) and Phi-4 (Abdin et al., 2024). However, there remains an ongoing debate as to whether LLMs genuinely learn the underlying logical rules or merely mimic patterns observed in the data (Marcus, 2003; Smolensky et al., 2022).

An alternative approach to enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs focuses on the model architecture and its training process. In one such study examining the use of Transformers to model compositional functions, it was observed that the scale of model parameter initialization significantly impacts the model’s reasoning behavior (Zhang et al., 2024a, 2025). Specifically, smaller initialization scales bias the model toward fitting the data by learning primitive-level functions and compositional rules, whereas larger initialization scales tend to encourage memorization of input-output mappings. A qualitative rationale for this phenomenon has been proposed: with a small initialization, a well-documented effect known as neuron condensation emerges during training (Xu et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Zhang & Xu, 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhang & Xu, 2024). This phenomenon suggests that neurons within the same layer tend to behave similarly, promoting data fitting with the least possible complexity. To achieve a low-complexity result, the model must learn a minimal set of rules leading to capture the intrinsic primitive functions and compositional rules. However, this rationale does not reveal a critical question: how the optimization process, together with the Transformer structure, can achieve reasoning solutions with small initialization?

In this work, we identify a reasoning bias during the training of neural networks that learn natural language when initialized with small parameter scales. To illustrate this phenomenon, we employ a GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019) to train on a mixed dataset comprising two types of language data with distinct levels of reasoning complexity, within a single next-token prediction training framework. The first dataset, PrOntoQA (Saparov & He, 2023), consists of question-answering examples that include chains of thought, which explicitly describe the reasoning necessary to answer the questions correctly. The second dataset, TinyStories (Eldan & Li, 2023), is a synthetic corpus of short stories containing only words typically understood by children aged 3 to 4 years. As shown in Figure 1, the training loss for PrOntoQA decreases significantly faster than for TinyStories, suggesting that the model encounters and learns the reasoning patterns more readily.

We uncover a key mechanism whereby reasoning tasks are learned earlier during training because the tokens associated with these tasks become more differentiated in the embedding space at an early stage of the training process. We validate this mechanism using both synthetic data and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the evolution of token embeddings, which depends on the distribution of sample labels. Since each token is encoded as a one-hot vector, its embedding is adjusted based on the loss associated with the labels of that token. Consequently, different label distributions can lead to distinct learning behaviors for token embeddings. For memory tasks, the labels associated with each token are typically random and lack explicit structure, which results in similar distributions for different memory token labels. As a result, the embeddings for memory tokens are difficult to differentiate in the early stages of training. In contrast, reasoning tokens often exhibit distinct label distributions, leading to more differentiated embedding vectors for these tokens. These insights are elaborated through a simplified model using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and embedding structure, followed by an analysis of a Transformer model.

The primary contribution of this research lies in uncovering the impact of the parameter initialization scale on the training behavior and task preferences of LLMs. By combining theoretical analysis with empirical evidence, we enhance the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provide new insights for optimizing model initialization strategies.
