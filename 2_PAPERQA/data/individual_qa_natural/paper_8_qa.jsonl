{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What are some of the tasks involved in image editing?", "answer": "Tasks in image editing include adding or removing objects, changing colors, textures, or styles, and taking actions such as moving objects or changing actor positions."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, Why is image editing considered a complex task?", "answer": "Image editing is complex because it requires fine-grained understanding of visual scene composition and reasoning, such as spatial instructions and referring expressions."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What is the 'inpainting paradigm' in image editing models?", "answer": "The 'inpainting paradigm' refers to models that perform localized changes, typically adding or removing objects or editing attributes within an image."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What are the limitations of current image editing models?", "answer": "Current models can only perform localized edits like object addition/removal or attribute changes and cannot handle edits requiring holistic visual understanding or complex actions."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, How have some researchers tried to address the limitations of image editing models?", "answer": "Researchers have introduced specialized model architectures to handle different image editing subtasks, but these still lack holistic visual understanding."}

{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, Why is finetuning data for object or attribute changes easier to acquire?", "answer": "Such data is easier to get because inpainting setups leverage strong object and attribute abilities of text-to-image models for paired-image data generation."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, Why is solving data scarcity for action and reasoning-centric edits more challenging?", "answer": "It is more challenging because generating high-quality paired examples for these types of edits requires more complex data sources and minimal changes."}

{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What happens when models are trained on noisy synthetic image pairs or video frames?", "answer": "Models trained on noisy synthetic data tend to have poor editing abilities."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What does 'noisy' mean in the context of synthetic image pairs?", "answer": "'Noisy' refers to image pairs with changes not mentioned in the prompt, often due to automatic generation shortcomings or irrelevant changes in video frames."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What is the main requirement for high-quality action and reasoning-centric edit examples?", "answer": "High-quality examples must be truly minimal, containing only one or two semantic changes described by the prompt, with all other aspects unchanged."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What is the AURORA Dataset?", "answer": "The AURORA Dataset is a curated collection of truly-minimal image edit pairs from videos and simulation engines for instruction-tuned image editing."}

{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, How is the AURORA dataset collected?", "answer": "It is collected via crowd-sourcing and curation from diverse video sources and simulation engines."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What do commonly used image-text-alignment metrics measure in image editing?", "answer": "These metrics mostly measure visual similarity to groundtruth and the ability to stay faithful (i.e., copy) to the source image."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, Why are existing metrics insufficient for action and reasoning-centric edits?", "answer": "They have almost no correlation with a model’s ability to generate accurate action and reasoning-centric edits."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What is AURORA-BENCH?", "answer": "AURORA-BENCH is a manually annotated benchmark for evaluating image editing models on 8 editing tasks using human judgment."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What inspires the novel discriminative metric introduced in the paper?", "answer": "It is inspired by work on using image generation models as discriminators."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What does the novel discriminative metric assess?", "answer": "It assesses both understanding and hallucination in image editing models."}

{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, Why is faithfulness an important first step for image editing models?", "answer": "Faithfulness ensures the edited image remains as close as possible to the source image except for the intended changes."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What is the importance of semantic evaluation in image editing?", "answer": "Semantic evaluation is crucial to assess the accuracy and relevance of edits beyond mere visual similarity."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 8, What is meant by 'instruction-tuned' image editing?", "answer": "Instruction-tuned image editing refers to models trained to perform edits based on specific textual instructions."}
