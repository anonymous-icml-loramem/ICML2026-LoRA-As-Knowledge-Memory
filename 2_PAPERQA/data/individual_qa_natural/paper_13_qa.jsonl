{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is a striking feature of large language models (LLMs)?", "answer": "LLMs can process high-level concepts through rich representations in their activations."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What technique leverages learned representations in LLMs to alter their behavior?", "answer": "Activation steering is a technique that leverages learned representations in LLMs to efficiently and predictably alter model behavior."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is a key limitation of current activation steering methods?", "answer": "Current activation steering methods lack conditional control, meaning they cannot selectively decide when and what to refuse."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, How does activation steering typically modify LLM behavior?", "answer": "It modifies LLM behavior by directly manipulating native representations, often by simply adding an activation vector during each forward call."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What happens when a 'refusal vector' is added using existing activation steering methods?", "answer": "Adding a 'refusal vector' increases refusal rates indiscriminately across all inputs, leading to reduced utility of the model."}

{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What new type of vector does CAST introduce?", "answer": "CAST introduces the 'condition vector', which represents activation patterns induced by the prompt during inference."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, How does CAST decide whether to apply the refusal vector?", "answer": "CAST uses a similarity calculation between the condition vector and the model's activation at inference time to determine whether to apply the refusal vector."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What does CAST allow models to do regarding harmful prompts?", "answer": "CAST allows selective refusal of harmful prompts while maintaining the ability to respond to harmless ones."}

{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What alignment goal does CAST help achieve?", "answer": "CAST helps in contextually refusing specific classes of instructions based on content."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, Why are traditional methods like preference modeling challenging for selective refusal?", "answer": "They are resource-intensive and struggle with subjective, black-box rewards."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, Why is defining harmful content difficult across contexts?", "answer": "Because the definition of harmful content varies depending on the context and usage, such as medical advice being harmful in some situations but essential in others."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, How does CAST allow for selective modification of responses?", "answer": "CAST enables selective modification by implementing behavioral rules, such as refusing hate speech or adult content, without weight optimization."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What consistent technical insight underlies CAST?", "answer": "Different prompts consistently activate distinct patterns in the model's hidden states during inference."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, How can these activation patterns be used in CAST?", "answer": "They can be extracted as steering vectors and used as reference points to detect specific prompt categories or contexts."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is the dual role of steering vectors in CAST?", "answer": "Steering vectors serve both as mechanisms for behavior modification and as condition indicators (condition vectors)."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is the first contribution listed in the paper?", "answer": "The introduction of conditional activation steering and condition vectors, which adds controllability to existing methods."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is the second contribution listed?", "answer": "Demonstrating the logical composition of condition vectors to create custom refusal conditions."}

{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What simple operation is used in activation steering to alter behavior?", "answer": "A simple activation addition step during each forward call."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What problem does indiscriminate refusal cause?", "answer": "It limits the model's utility because it refuses all inputs regardless of context or content."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, How does CAST maintain efficiency?", "answer": "CAST maintains the data, runtime, and compute efficiency of traditional activation steering methods."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, Can CAST implement complex behavioral rules?", "answer": "Yes, CAST can implement rules like refusing input about hate speech or adult content, or refusing unless input is about legal advice."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What figure shows selective refusal of harmful prompts?", "answer": "Figure 1 depicts selective refusal, and Table 3 provides a breakdown."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, How does context affect the definition of harmful content?", "answer": "The definition of harmful content can change based on the context or usage, such as medical advice being harmful in general but necessary for medical chatbots."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What does logical composition of condition vectors enable?", "answer": "It allows for the creation of custom refusal conditions tailored to specific needs."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What does the activation steering toolkit include?", "answer": "It includes demo datasets for the activation engineering community."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is the purpose of the similarity calculation in CAST?", "answer": "To determine whether the refusal vector should be applied by comparing the condition vector to the current activation."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is the difference between steering vectors and condition vectors?", "answer": "Steering vectors are used to modify behavior, while condition vectors serve as indicators for when to apply those modifications."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, Who benefits from the activation steering toolkit release?", "answer": "The broader activation engineering community."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is a key step towards tailoring model behavior mentioned in the paper?", "answer": "The logical composition of condition vectors to create custom refusal conditions."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, Why might preference modeling be impractical for every situation?", "answer": "Because it is resource-intensive and does not handle subjective or context-dependent rewards well."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, How does CAST differ from optimization-based techniques?", "answer": "CAST directly manipulates native representations using activation vectors, avoiding the need for resource-intensive optimization."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What challenge arises when trying to create universal harm models?", "answer": "The variability of harm definitions across contexts makes it difficult to create universal harm models."}
{"question": "In the Paper ID 13, What is the role of the condition vector during inference?", "answer": "It represents activation patterns induced by the prompt and helps decide whether to apply behavioral modification."}
